    "description": "Mairi MacLean of Ruaig was recorded by Co-Chomunn Dualchas Thiriodh singing ‘’S e Tiriodh an t-eilean’ (‘Tiree is the island’), an unpublished song probably written by Neil MacLaine, a nephew of John MacLean, Bard Tighearna Cholla, and a bard himself.

While at school in Tiree, Mairi competed in several Mods. She won first prize singing this song at the Mod in Inverness in 1972. That same year she came third in the silver medal competition for singing a set Gaelic song.

Mairi has worked as a district nurse in Tiree for eighteen years. Before returning to Tiree she worked as a district nurse in Oban and Glasgow."
