He ran off in terror and left his coat behind.  The water-horse tore the coat into shreds and then made after the man.  The dogs came out when it came near the house and drove it away.\r\n\tFootnote 362; Loch an \u00c0ir is in the south-eastern tip of Tiree near Rubha Nead Ge\u00f2idh, Rubha a\u2019 Bhodaich and Port an Duin.  The name suggests \u2018the Loch of Slaughter\u2019 or \u2018of Ploughing\u2019.  There is nothing in oral tradition to suggest that it could have been the site of  a battle, so the latter meaning is perhaps more likely, but the water-horse connection could well have given rise to either \u2013 or both.  Niall M. Brownlie has drawn my attention to this verse in a song by Captain Alick MacDonald, Milton, Caolas (Brownlie 1991a, p.23):\r\n\tAig Taigh Loch an \u00c0ir thogadh iomadh deagh bh\u00e0ta,\r\nAinmeil bhon l\u00e0imh chluicheadh t\u00e0l agus tuagh;\r\nAm beagan th\u2019 air fh\u00e0gail den tobhta tha\u2019n l\u00e0thair,\r\nTha mo chridh\u2019 ann am b\u00e0idh rith\u2019 seach \u00e0ite mun cuairt.\r\n(\u201cAt Loch an \u00c0ir House were built many fine boats, \/ Made famous by the hand which would wield adze and axe;\/My heart loves the little that\u2019s left of the ruins \/ More than anywhere else in the district around.\u201d)\r\nBy \u2018last century\u2019 JGC means eighteenth.",

The press gang caught Neil and Iain and were closing in on Eachann when he came to this gully. Without hesitating he jumped over although it was a difficult feat as the ground slopes downwards before the gully of eight or nine feet. He turned to face his pursuers, daring them to jump after him. As the first one jumped Eachann hit him in the face and so he escaped. Neil and Iain never returned. He was also told a story about a bull jumping here, and he asked the old men why they were telling him this story rather than the one about the press gang. He was told it was better to forget these things. When he was young he had a huge Scout knife and used to go up and clean the two footprints and Donald Kennedy did the same.

In his day lucifer matches were unknown, and when corn was kiln-dried a person had to sit up all night to keep the fire alive. As Donald sat at this work in a solitary hut - such as small kilns are still kept in - the figure of his first wife appeared and told him to beware, for 'the terror' (an t-eagal) was coming: it was at Crudh an Eich, the 'Horse Shoe', a spot on the public road leading to Caolas, about a mile and a half distant, deriving its name from the clear likeness of a horseshoe indented in the rock.\r\nHe, however, was dozing into sleep again when his second wife, in more distressed tones warned him the 'terror' was nearer hand - at Cachala na C\u00f9il Connaidh, 'the Gateway of the Fuel Enclosure'. He neglected this warning also, and was dozing again when his third wife warned him that the 'terror' was at Bail' Uachdrach (Upper Village).\r\nHe immediately went home and had hardly got into bed when a sound like the rushing of a violent blast of wind passed, and the whole house was shaken so that the walls were like to fall.

He said that after leaving the rock the evening before he remembered nothing but passing a number of beaches.  The white beaches of Tiree, from the surrounding land being a dead level, are at night the most noticeable features in the scenery.  On coming to his senses, he found himself on the top of the D\u00f9n at Caolas in the extreme east end of the island, twelve miles from his starting point.\r\n\r\np 74:\r\nSounds of exquisite music, as if played by a piper marching at the head of a procession, used to be heard going underground from the Harp Hillock to the top of the D\u00f9n at Caolas in the east end of Tiree.  Many tunes of little poetical (whatever be their musical) merit said to have been learned from the Fairies are to be heard.  One of these which the writer heard seemed to consist entirely of variations upon the word \u2018do-lledl\u2019em.\u2019 (Footnote 237)\r\nFootnote 237\t\r\nThe motif is defined by MacDonald (1994-95, p.55) as \u2018fairy song (a) or tune (b) overheard and learned.\u2019  Cnoc na Cl\u00e0rsaich, \u2018Harp Hillock\u2019, is at Port B\u00e0n on the eastern tip of Tiree, strongly resembles one summarised by JGC at p. 51 as: \u201cA man who avoided tethering horse or cow on a Fairy hillock...was rewarded by the Fairies driving his horse and cow to the lee of the hillock in stormy nights.\u201d  See Spence 1948, pp. 182-84.",

Lachie wrote down the timber he needed to order and was walking to post the letter when he walked past the shore which was covered in timber. Duncan Cameron, Scarinish, 4\/09. Confirmed by Angus MacLean, Scarinish, and Mary Ann MacLennan,  5\/2009.\r\n\r\nThe Camerons moved from Craignish either in 1910 or 1912. They were fishermen but fishing was becoming less profitable and they had no ground for crofting. They put in for MacFadyen\u2019s farm at M\u00ecodar when it became vacant and they were successful. This farm was put together from 3-4 crofts. One was Croit Ailein a\u2019 Grudaire or Croit Iain mhic Ailein (nearest Urvaig), and another Croit a\u2019 Ch\u00e0rnain (MacLeans).

In his day lucifer matches were unknown, and when corn was kiln-dried a person had to sit up all night to keep the fire alive. As Donald sat at this work in a solitary hut - such as small kilns are still kept in - the figure of his first wife appeared and told him to beware, for 'the terror' (an t-eagal) was coming: it was at Crudh an Eich, the 'Horse Shoe', a spot on the public road leading to Caolas, about a mile and a half distant, deriving its name from the clear likeness of a horseshoe indented in the rock.\r\nHe, however, was dozing into sleep again when his second wife, in more distressed tones warned him the 'terror' was nearer hand - at Cachala na C\u00f9il Connaidh, 'the Gateway of the Fuel Enclosure'. He neglected this warning also, and was dozing again when his third wife warned him that the 'terror' was at Bail' Uachdrach (Upper Village).\r\nHe immediately went home and had hardly got into bed when a sound like the rushing of a violent blast of wind passed, and the whole house was shaken so that the walls were like to fall. If this was not the 'terror' of which he had been so strangely warned, Donald could give no other explanation.",

Iain Glas had been tipped off and had disguised himself as a poor man. He told the visitors that Iain Glas was away but would be back later and offered them whisky. The party became drunk and Iain Glas attacked them. Two ran off in the direction of Beinn Ghot. Iain Glas caught them in the pass between Beinn Ghot and D\u00f9n an t-Sithein, killed them and buried them there. The last one was killed in Croit a Bhuth - John George MacLean, Scarinish, 11\/1993 and 1\/1995.\r\n\r\nThere used to be warning fires on all the hills of Tiree, for example at D\u00f9n M\u00f2r a' Chaolais. Iain Glas was keeping watch in Sithean Beinn Ghot one night, but he was tired and fell asleep. When he awoke at dawn he saw a boat coming in to Scarinish harbour. He ran down to see what they wanted and they said they were from Jura and visiting Iona. They had become becalmed and had had to row against the tide to reach Tiree. In fact they were pirates. They asked Iain Glas if they could get shelter, so he took them to his house in Earnal and plied them with drink. When they fell asleep, he took their swords and slaughtered some while they slept. The chief ran away but he became bogged down near Cacaileith Iain Ghlais and Iain cut his head off - Lachie MacLean (Lachainn Sheumais), Vaul, 9\/1994 and Duncan MacPhee, Scarinish, 3\/1995.\r\n\r\nA man, Donald, from Kirkapol was walking past this gate with an empty pige, or stone jar, on his way to a shebeen in the west end of the island.

And this room in which - MacLean was his name as far as I know - murdered himself, was not opened at any time. No.\r\nEC Why did he kill himself, I wonder?\r\nDS Well, he made a mistake. He was a doctor in Tiree. And his father was a minister over there at the east end. And he was a boozer. And he was on the booze. And he gave out the wrong medicine to a certain lady. And she was dead. And when he came to his senses he realised what he had done. He went down to this room and poisoned himself. That's the true history about it.\r\nEC Yes, yes.

He ran down to see what they wanted and they said they were from Jura and visiting Iona. They had become becalmed and had had to row against the tide to reach Tiree. In fact they were pirates. They asked iain Glas if they could get shelter, so he took them to his house in Earnal and plied them with drink. When they fell asleep, he took their swords and slaughtered some while they slept.

        "stories":"Donald Sinclair (D\u00f2mhnall Chaluim B\u00e0in) worked at the construction of the new Gott Bay pier. He would leave his house in West Hynish at 2 am to start work at 4 am. Once, a crane broke and crashed into some scaffolding at the side of the pier. All the men on it were thrown into the sea, although no one was hurt. The crane had been set up by Neil \u00d2g Sinclair, Balephuil. By the end of the contract, Neil had returned to sea, and no one could dismantle it. In the end they just blew it up. The pier was built with jute bags filled with concrete and rubble.  Donald John Kennedy, West Hynish, 5\/2008.\r\n\r\nWhen Gott Bay pier was finished, the builders left a pile of materials and tools for Kenneth MacKenzie to sell. His uncle Sandy was looking around and asked if he could buy the jaws of a huge rock crusher. \u201cIf you can carry it away, you can have it,\u201d said Kenneth. He lifted it on his own into the cart, and not only that, he lifted it right over the wheel! It lay in the yard at Caolas and Angus once tried to lift it as a young man. He just managed it but swore never to do it again! Angus MacLean, Scarinish, 5\/2009.\r\n\r\nThis pier is in the wrong place. Its position was decided by Sleven, the manager of the Sandaig seaweed factory, and McDiarmid, the factor. It had a railway down the middle with a small bogey drawn by the horse of Alan MacFadyen, Gott. It was a busy place after the First World War as many of the returned soldiers were building houses - JAMcL.\r\n\r\nThe bogey would run down the pier by itself but Ailean mac Dhonnchaidh's horse would pull t back up. The rest of the time the horse woud work on the roads. The piermasters were Kenneth MacKenzie, Iain 'Noan' MacDonald, Donald Kennedy, Johnny O'Neill, Lachaln MacKinon, Brock, and Alan Campbell, Diobadal - Annie Kenedy, Scarinish, 5\/1998.",

This story could possibly relate to this building:\r\nAbout a hundred years ago one of the tenants of this farm, which adjoins Baugh, wondering what made his cows leave the fank (or enclosure) every night, resolved to watch.  He built a small turf hut near the fold to pass the night in, and sat mending his cuarain (shoes or moccasins of untanned hides), whne a woman came to the door.  Suspicious of her being and earthy visitant, he struck his awl in the door-post to keep her out. (Footnote 309).  She asked him to withdraw the awl and let her in, but he refused.\r\nFootnote 309: JGC means suspicious in its old sense \u2018doubtful, uncertain.\u2019\r\nHe asked her questions which much troubled him at the time.  He was afraid of a conscription which was then impending, and he asked if he would habe to go to the army.  The glaistig said he would; that though he made a hole in the rock his awl and hide himself in it, he would be found out and taken away, but if he succeeded in mounting a certain black horse before his pursuers came, he might bid them defiance; and he was to tell the wife who owned the white-faced yellow cow to let the produce of the cows home to their master.\r\n\tThe man was caught when jumping on the back of the black horse to run away from the conscription, and, after service abroad, came back to tell the tale.",

He did not at first observe anything in her appearance different from other women, but, on her putting over her head and kissing him, he saw she had but one nostril.  On reaching home he was unable to articulate one word.\r\n\tBy the advice of an old man he composed, in his mind, a love song to the Fairy.  On doing this, his speech came back.\r\n\r\np75:\r\nOn the North shore of Tiree there is a beach of more than a mile in length called Cladach a\u2019 Chr\u00f2gain, well calculated to be the scene of strange terrors.  The extensive plain (about 1,500 acres in extent) of which it forms the northern fringe is almost a dead level, and in instances of very high flood-tides, with north-west gales of wind, the sea has been known to overflow it and join the sea on the south side three miles away, dividing Tiree into two islands.  The upper part of the beach consists of loose round stones, a little larger than a goose\u2019s egg, which make \u2013 when the tide is in, and under the influence of the restless surf \u2013 a hoarse rumbling sound, sufficienty calculated, with the accompaniment of strange scenery, to awaken the imagination.\r\n\r\np186:\r\nWitches as Sheep\r\nA native of Tiree was on his way home to the west end of the island in the evening with a new gun in his hand.  When above the beach called Travay, he observed a black sheep running towards him from across the plain of Reef.  Alarmed by the animal\u2019s motions, he put a silver sixpence in the gun, and on its coming near enough, took aim.  The black sheep instantly became a woman (whom he recognised) with a drugget coat wrapped around her head.\r\n\tThe same woman had often persecuted him before, often in shape of cat.  She asked him to keep her secret, and he promised to do so, but one day, when drunk in the village to which the woman belonged to, he told his adventure and the name of the woman.  In less than a fortnight after, he was drowned, and the witch (for such the woman was universally reputed to be) was blamed as the cause.",

Bean MhicGuaire had a stall with juice and biscuits. The sports always ended with a tug of war between the islanders and visitors. The sports included a horse race across the Reef from Drochaid na Fhaodhalach. It was always won by Donald Munn from Lag nan Cruachan. Iain Chaluim MacKinnon, Kilmoluaig, 6\/2000.\r\n\r\nIt was at Cnoc nan Deilgean that the Tiree Association used to hold their annual sports, and a story is told of two men from Balephuil who met in the wrestling finals. The stalwarts were Donald MacLean and Colin MacDonald. MacLean was a big, powerful man while MacDonald was small and stocky. Eventually, however, MacDonald got the better of his opponent.\r\nAfter his victory, a friend of MacLean's remarked to him that he never thought he would live to see the day when his friend would be bested by a man as small as Colin, to which the worthy Colin replied, \"It is only something I have done often - laying MacLean flat out on his back on the Balephuil machair!\" - Bailtean is Ath-Ghairmean, Townships and Echoes by Niall M Brownlie, Argyll Publishing, 1995, p34.\r\n\r\nThere was a cattle market here twice in the old days with Speedy Brothers as auctioneers - Sandy MacKinnon, Kilkenneth, 2\/1994.\r\n\r\nThe cattle sale was at E\u00f2ghann Fhortaidh's.

If true (Mrs Fagg mistakenly attributes the staement to SHIS) the legend thus contains both a motive for destroying such stones and a warning against doing so...Compare Newton 1992 p145 where it is claimed that if Clach a' Choire 'ever shatters or falls off the pedestal of small stones on which it rests, Tiree will sink beneath the waves.'",

        "miscellaneous":"Extract from 'The Gaelic Otherworld' by John Gregorson Campbell, Edited with commentary by Ronald Black, Edinburgh; Birlinn, 2005, p 115 and p 371:\r\n\r\nNot far from the south end of the same loch there is a place called Fhuaire na h-Aon Oidhch the One Night\u2019s Watch\u2019), said to derive its name from an incident of which the water-horse was the hero, similar to that told of the urisk of Gleann M\u00e0ili (see page 106).\r\n\r\nFootnote 368: This is a curiosity.  Since JGC describes the water-horse as the \u2018hero\u2019 of the incident, it must be a simple story of how it recognised a man dressed in woman\u2019s clothes, as at p.106 above (SHIS 197).  However, Fhaire na h-Aon Oidhch\u2019 is hard to dissociate from \u00c0irigh na h-Aon Oidhche (\u2018the One Night\u2019s Sheiling\u2019), the location of a vampire tale similar to \u2018MacPhie\u2019s Black Dog\u2019 (pp.58-64 above); indeed a version from Benbecula published by Bruford and MacDonald (1994, pp. 318-19, 470) consists of the vampire story with the dog as an additional character, while JCG himself once remarked as \u2018MacPhie\u2019s Black Dog\u2019 (\u2018Campbell 1885b, p. 263): \u201cIt is known in the Western Islands as the \u2018One Night\u2019s Watch\u2019 (Aire na h-aon oidhche).\u201d",

        "stories":"The Gaelic Otherworld, ed Ronald Black, p282:\r\nAbout seventy years ago a young man, a native of the village of Cornaig in Tiree, went in the evening to another village, Cruaidh-Ghortain, about two miles distant.  When he reached it, he reclined on a bed, and being tired fell fast asleep.  He awoke with a start, and thinking from the clearness of the night (it was a full moon) daylight had come, hurried off home.\r\n\tHis way lay across a desolate moor called the Druim Buidhe (\u2018Yellow Ridge\u2019), and when halfway he heard a loud whistle behind him, but in a different direction from that in which he had come \u2013 at a distance , as he thought, of above a mile.  The whitle was so unearthly loud he thought every person in the island must have heard it.  He hurried on, and when opposite an Carragh Biorach (\u2018the Sharp-Pointed Rock\u2019) he heard the whistle again, as if at the place where he himself had been when he heard it first.  The whistle was so clear and loud that it sent a shiver through his very marrow. (Footnote 941)\r\n\tWith a beating heart he quickened his pace, and when at the gateway adjoining the village he belonged to, he heard the whistle at the Pointed Rock.  He here made off the road and managed to reach home before being overtaken.  He rushed into the barn where he usually slept, and, after one look towards the door at his pursuer, buried himself below a pile of corn.\r\n\tHis brother was in abed in the same barn asleep.  His father was in the house, and three times, with an interval between each call, heard a voice at the door saying, \u201cAre you asleep?  Will you not go to look at your son? He is in danger of his life, and in risk of all he is worth (an geall nas fhiach e). (Footnote 942)\r\n\tEach call became more importunate, and at last the old man rose and went to the barn.  After a search he found his son below a pile of sheaves, and nearly dead.  The only account the young man could give was that when he stood at the door he could see the sky between the legs of his pursuer, who came to the door and said it was fortunate for him he had reached shelter; and that he (the pursuer) was such a one who had been killed in Bl\u00e0r nam Bigein, the \u2018Field of the Birds\u2019 in the Moss, a part of Tiree near hand. (Footnote 943)\r\n\tIn its main outline, this tale may be correct enough.  A hideous nightmare or terror had made the fatigued young man hide himself under the corn, and things as strange have happened, in the history or nervous delusions, as that he should have gone himself to the door of the dwelling-house to call his father.\r\nFootnote 942\r\nAn geall nas fhiach e is a characteristic Tiree expression for \u2018virtually at  death\u2019s door\u2019; \u2018in risk of all he is worth\u2019 is the more literal meaning.\r\n\r\nFootnote 943\r\nAs it stands in Wss 205 this phrase is \u2018the Field of the Birds\u2019 (Blar nam Big-ein) in the Moas, \u2018a part of Tiree near hand.\u2019  I have prioritised the Gaelic name over JGC\u2019s English translation in line with our editiorial policy.  Big-ein I take to be JGC\u2019s way of showing that the word is made up of by-forms of beag \u2018little\u2019 and eun \u2018bird\u2019; it is Dwelly\u2019s bigein \u2018rock-pipot, golden-crested wren, meadow pipt, any little bird\u2019 (1977, p\/ 93). \u2018Moas\u2019 will be a misprint, or a misreading of JCG\u2019s handwriting.  According to oral tradition Bl\u00e0r nam bigein was the site of a battle which took place centuries ago in Mointeach nam Bigeannan (\u2018the Birds\u2019 Mossland\u2019) in Moss, in the west of Tiree; it is now part of the Barrapol common.  The village of Moss is known as a\u2019 Mh\u00f2inteach Ruadh \u2018the Red Mossland\u2019. The story is told, again in English (with a Gaelic translation, apparently not by a speaker of Tiree Gaelic), as MacKinnon 1992, no.13.  The man slain in the battle is there named as D\u00f2mhnall M\u00f2r.",

They were brothers, and it was said the water-horse came every night in the shape of a young man to see a sister who staid with them.\r\n\r\nWith the tendency of popular tales to attach themselves to known persons, this incident is related of Calum M\u00f2r Clark and his family.  Calum had three sons, Iain B\u00e0n M\u00f2r (\u2018Big Fair John\u2019), Iain B\u00e0n \u00d2g (\u2018Young Fair John\u2019) and Iain B\u00e0n Meadhonach (\u2018Middle Fair John\u2019).\r\n\r\nThe four conspired to beguile the young  man from the loch \u2013 who came to see the daughter \u2013 into the house, and got him to sit between the two of them on the front of the bed.  On a given signal these two clasped their hands round him and laid him on his back in the bed.  The other two rushed to their assistance; the young man assumed his proper shape of a water-horse, and a fearful struggle ensued.  The conspirators cut the horse in pieces with their dirks, and put it out of the house dead.\r\n\r\nNote 367, p371: An account of the surrender of weapons at Scarinish on 24 SApril 1716 lists three sons of this Malcolm Clerk or Clark, none of whom had taken part in the previous yera's rising, and only one of whom was called John....On the other hand, in an account of the feats of stregnth attibuted to Malcolm Clerk of Kilmoluaig, whom he calls 'one of the remarkable men of Tiree', Donald Bane and Charles.",

In 1696 an Act of the Scottish Parliament established the principle that would set up a Church of Scotland Parochial School in every parish in Scotland, paid for by the Church and local landowners. These schools would be open to all regardless of how rich or poor you were (The Scottish Educational System 1840 -1940, WW Knox, SCRAN website).\r\n\r\nIt took some time for this to be put into effect on Tiree, but by at least the 1780s there was one Parochial school on Tiree in Cornaigmore at An Taigh Shearmoin, with a Mr Buchanan installed as school master...\r\nBy 1795, however, the Cornaig school master, Buchanan, had fallen foul of the estate.\r\nAs it appears that Buchanan is now of no use as schoolmaster you should get rid of him as soon as possible and correspond with Mr. Kemp and Mr. Ferrier [James Ferrier, the Duke\u2019s agent in Edinburgh, Instructions p. X] about a successor to him, and let the necessary accommodations be provided in time for his successor. Buchanan may be allowed something to carry him to Perthshire, his native country (Instructions p 40).\r\n\r\nIt took six years to move the reluctant teacher. The Duke wrote in exasperation in 1801,\r\nGet Buchanan and his son out of the island as soon as possible. I shall pay the old man \u00a310 yearly during his life providing he goes away peaceably. The son I will have nothing to do with. Another schoolmaster to be looked for, and one of the natives to be preferred, if qualified (Instructions p 57).\r\n\r\nThe factor was able to report later that year,\r\nBuchanan the schoolmaster was removed at last Whitsunday, enjoying his allowance of \u00a310 for life according to your Grace\u2019s instructions. His son is dead (Instructions p 62-3). From 'Ministers and Deep Sea Captains' a history of Tiree Schools by An Iodhlann, 2011.",

        "stories":"The Gaelic Otherworld, ed Ronald Black, p282:\r\n\r\nAbout seventy years ago a young man, a native of the village of Cornaig in Tiree, went in the evening to another village, Cruaidh-Ghortain, about two miles distant.  When he reached it, he reclined on a bed, and being tired fell fast asleep.  He awoke with a start, and thinking from the clearness of the night (it was a full moon) daylight had come, hurried off home.\r\n\tHis way lay across a desolate moor called the Druim Buidhe (\u2018Yellow Ridge\u2019), and when halfway he heard a loud whistle behind him, but in a different direction from that in which he had come \u2013 at a distance , as he thought, of above a mile.  The whitle was so unearthly loud he thought every person in the island must have heard it.  He hurried on, and when opposite an Carragh Biorach (\u2018the Sharp-Pointed Rock\u2019) he heard the whistle again, as if at the place where he himself had been when he heard it first.  The whistle was so clear and loud that it sent a shiver through his very marrow. (Footnote 941)\r\n\tWith a beating heart he quickened his pace, and when at the gateway adjoining the village he belonged to, he heard the whistle at the Pointed Rock.  He here made off the road and managed to reach home before being overtaken.  He rushed into the barn where he usually slept, and, after one look towards the door at his pursuer, buried himself below a pile of corn.\r\n\tHis brother was in abed in the same barn asleep.  His father was in the house, and three times, with an interval between each call, heard a voice at the door saying, \u201cAre you asleep?  Will you not go to look at your son? He is in danger of his life, and in risk of all he is worth (an geall nas fhiach e). (Footnote 942)\r\n\tEach call became more importunate, and at last the old man rose and went to the barn.  After a search he found his son below a pile of sheaves, and nearly dead.  The only account the young man could give was that when he stood at the door he could see the sky between the legs of his pursuer, who came to the door and said it was fortunate for him he had reached shelter; and that he (the pursuer) was such a one who had been killed in Bl\u00e0r nam Bigein, the \u2018Field of the Birds\u2019 in the Moss, a part of Tiree near hand. (Footnote 943)\r\n\tIn its main outline, this tale may be correct enough.  A hideous nightmare or terror had made the fatigued young man hide himself under the corn, and things as strange have happened, in the history or nervous delusions, as that he should have gone himself to the door of the dwelling-house to call his father.\r\nFootnote 942\r\n'An geall nas fhiach e' is a characteristic Tiree expression for \u2018virtually at  death\u2019s door\u2019; \u2018in risk of all he is worth\u2019 is the more literal meaning.\r\n\r\nFootnote 943\r\nAs it stands in Wss 205 this phrase is \u2018the Field of the Birds\u2019 (Blar nam Big-ein) in the Moas, \u2018a part of Tiree near hand.\u2019  I have prioritised the Gaelic name over JGC\u2019s English translation in line with our editiorial policy.  Big-ein I take to be JGC\u2019s way of showing that the word is made up of by-forms of beag \u2018little\u2019 and eun \u2018bird\u2019; it is Dwelly\u2019s bigein \u2018rock-pipot, golden-crested wren, meadow pipt, any little bird\u2019 (1977, p\/ 93). \u2018Moas\u2019 will be a misprint, or a misreading of JCG\u2019s handwriting.  According to oral tradition Bl\u00e0r nam bigein was the site of a battle which took place centuries ago in Mointeach nam Bigeannan (\u2018the Birds\u2019 Mossland\u2019) in Moss, in the west of Tiree; it is now part of the Barrapol common.  The village of Moss is known as a\u2019 Mh\u00f2inteach Ruadh \u2018the Red Mossland\u2019. The story is told, again in English (with a Gaelic translation, apparently not by a speaker of Tiree Gaelic), as MacKinnon 1992, no.13.  The man slain in the battle is there named as D\u00f2mhnall M\u00f2r.",

According to oral sources, it was customary for the MacLeans, when they held sway on Tiree, to hang the person who was last to pay his rent. And the last person to suffer the indignity was a miller's son from Balevullin. His sister was gathering shellfish when word came to her that her brother had been arrested. In great haste she left for Island House to plead for his life. But the dastardly deed was done before she arrived. All MacLean could say to her was that, if she had arrived earlier, he would certainly have spared her brother's life. This is a translation of what a bard said at the time:\r\nSon of him from Balevullin\r\nWho had the kiln, the grain and the mill,\r\nAt the Bay you were dishonoured.\r\nWe also have another story from the time of Am B\u00e0illidh M\u00f2r, the Big Factor - one of the worst tyrants to reside in Island House. The road leading to Island House has a gravel surface, and on a cold and frosty November day, in her bare feet, a woman from Balephuil came to pay the rent. As she found it very painful to walk on the hard gravel, she took to the grass, but when she arrived at the office, the Colonel turned her away, ordering her to walk on the gravel or the rent would not be accepted and she would be evicted. Bailtean is Ath-Ghairmean, Niall M Brownlie, Argyll Publishing, 1995, p106.\r\n\r\nExtract from \u2018Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition V. Argyllshire Series\u2019 Collected from Oral Sources by the Late Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, Minister of Tiree, Selected from the Author\u2019s MS. Remains, and Edited by Jessie Wallace and Duncan MacIssac, with Introducation by Alfred Nutt. (London; David Nutt, 1895)\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree at the present day are called Brunaich, sing.  Brunach, evidently a word not of a native origin, and likely and adaption of the English Brown.  Brown as the name of a colour is an English word but not Gaelic, the Gaelic for it being donn, hence as a clan name many affirm that the Brown of the present day is a corruption or modification of Bruthainn certainly the older name, and till very recently, the name given to sept or portion of the Browns.  There are also many who maintain the oldest form of all is Mac \u2013\u2019ill-duinn.\r\n\r\nOther explanations are also put forward in behalf of the origin of the name, but none of them are satisfactorily conclusive.  The following story of how the Browns came first to Tiree is a tradition as like to be true as any other.  It was heard from a native of the island, well acquainted with the traditions of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe wife of MacLean of Dowart was a daughter of the Lord of the Isles Her father on visiting her at Aros has found her destitute of table-linen, and on her being spoken to on the subject, she said that there was no place on the estate where lint could be grown.  Her father then gave her the island of Tiree as a good flax-growing country, then she might not be open to that reproach any longer.  In this way the island of Tiree remained in the possession of the Dowart family till the forfeiture of the clan towards the end of the seventeenth century.  The MacLeans seem to have ruled the island with a rod of iron.  There is still shewn the hillock called the Bank of the Gallows (Bac na Croiche), where the man who came in last with his rent at collection time was hanged.  A party of strong men called \u2018MacLean\u2019s attributes\u2019 (buaidheanan Mhic-\u2019illeathain) but more correctly oppressors and bullies, were kept in the island to overawe the people.\r\n\r\nThis wife of Dowart, with her galley and men, was at Croig in Mull, awaiting for a passage across to Tiree.  When teh men were getting the galley in order, a big strong man was observed making his way to the boat, His appearance was that of a beggar, with tattered and patched garments (l\u00f9irichean). He quietly asked to be allowed a passage with them.  The master of the boat gruffly refused, saying, that they would not allow one like him to be in the same boat with their mistress, but the beggar said that his being there would make no difference, and asked the favour of getting a passage from her.  She gave him permission and he seated himself at the end of the boat furthest from her to avoid giving trouble to her.  The day was becoming boisterous; it was not long till the master said that the wind was becoming to high, and the day unlikely.  A heavy sea was shipped wetting the Lady of Dowart, and the beggar said to the master, \u201cCan you do better?\u201d  The beggar replied \u201cIt would not be difficult for me to do better than that at any rate.  Show me the direction where you wish to go,\u201d and on it being shewn to him he added \u201cI think you may go on that you will make land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d the other said, \u201cit is none of your business to speak here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lady then spoke, and said to the beggar, \u201cWill you take the boat there if you get the command of it?\u201d  He said he would, and she gave orders to let him have the command.  He sat at the helm and told them to shorten sail, and make everything taut, and now, the boat did not take in a thimbleful of water.  They made for Tiree, and the place come to was the lower part of Hynish, at the furthest extremity of the island.  The first place of shelter which the beggar saw, he let the boat in there.  The little cove is still known as the Port of the Galley (Port-na-Birlinn) on the south side of Barradhu where the present dwellings belonging to the Skerryvore Lighthouse are.  The company landed safely, and on parting the Lady of Dowart told the beggar man to come to see her at Island House, where the residence of the Dowart family was at that time, and which is still the proprietory residence of the island.  The name Island House is derived from its present site having been formerly surrounded by the water of the fresh water lake near it.  It communicated with the rest of the island by means of a draw-bridge, but there being now no necessity for this safeguard the space between the house and the shore has been filled up, and the moated grange has become like ordinary dwelling houses.  The stranger wandered about for some time, and then went to the Island House and was kindly received.  After a day or two, he thought it would be better to get a house for himself, and the Lady of Dowart said that she would give him any place that he himself would fix upon.  Apparently the island was not much tenanted then, and according to the custom of the time, he got a horse with a pack-saddle on, and on the ridge of the saddle (cairb na srathach), he put the upper and lower stones of a quern (br\u00e0thainn), one on each side of the horse, secured by a straw or sea-bent rope, and wherever the rope broke it was lucky to build the house there.  The beggar-man\u2019s quern fell at Sunny Spot (Grianal), now better known as Greenhill.  He built a bothy there, and a woman came to keep house for him.  By her he had a son, whom he would not acknowledge.  When the child was able to take care of itself she went again to him with it that she might be free.  He still refused to receive the child and told her to avoid him.  She then thought as she had heard from him before where he came from, that she would go with her son to his relatives in Ireland.  When she arrived there the child\u2019s grandfather received her very kindly.  She stayed with him till her son had grown to manhood (gus an robh e \u2019na l\u00e0n duine). As she was about to return the grand-father said to his grandson, \u201cWhich do you now prefer, to follow your mother, or stay with me?\u201d  The lad said he would rather follow his mother, and risk his fortune along with her.  They came back to Tiree again, and the son would give no rest till they went to see his father.  When they reached the bothy the mother said \u201cyou will surely receive your son to-day though you would not acknowledge him before.\u201d  But he would not any more than at first.  His son then took hold of him, and putting his knee on his breast, said, \u201cbefore you rise from there you will own me as your son, and my mother as your married wife.\u201d  He did this and was set free.  They then lived together and built a house, and houses, and increased in stock of cattle.  One wild evening in spring, when they were folding the cattle, they observed a stout looking man of mean appearance coming from Kilkenneth, still a township in that part of the island, and making straight for the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw a bigger man than that beggar,\u201d said the son.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is big,\u201d the father said, \u201cI well know what man it is; he is coming after me, and I will lose my life this night, I killed his brother, but it was not my fault, for if I had not killed him, he would have killed me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will not lose your life to-night yet,\u201d said the son, \u201cbe kind to him, and when he has warmed himself, ask him to go out with us to kill a cow, for the night is cold.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger came in and was made welcome.  The old man then said since there was a stranger, and the night chill, they better take a cow and kill it.  They went out and brought in the cow.  The young-man said to the stranger, \u201cWhich would you rather, take the axe, or hold the cow\u2019s horn.?\u201d (Co dhiu b\u2019 fhearr leis an tuath ne\u2019n adharc). The stranger chose to hold the horn, and blow by which the beast was felled was so sudden and unexpected that the stranger fell with it.  The youth immediately fell upon him and kept him down, saying, \u201cYou will only have what you can do for yourself, till you tell why you came here to-night (Cha bhi agad ach na bheir thu g\u2019a chionns gus an aidich thu \u2019de thug so an nochd thu). He told word for word how he came to avenge his brother\u2019s death. (Dh\u2019 innis e facal air an fhacal mar thainig e thoirt mach \u00e8irig a br\u00e0thair).\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not leave this alive\u201d said the young man, \u201cuntil you promise not to molest my father while you remain in the country.\u201d  The stranger vowed, if released he would not offend anyone.  He was allowed to remain and they passed the night cheerfully and peacefully (gu sona s\u00e0mhach). The stranger returned the way he came.  The father and son then settled together, and are said according to tradition, to have been the first Browns in Tiree.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story is, that the first settler in Greenhill was a Campbell, and that he was the maker of those underground dwellings (tighean falaich) which still exist on that farm; curious habitations, which are unlike any building now in use, and worthy of closer examination by antiquarians.  It is said that there are buildings with similar entrances exposed by sand blowing and covered with a great depth of earth in Tra-vi at the distance of two miles or more further south.\r\n\r\nThere is a precipice on the west side of Kenavara hill called Mac-a-Bhriuthainn\u2019s leap (Leum Mhic-a-bhriuthainn) which one of this sept of Browns is said to have jumped across backwards, and which no one has since jumped either backwards or forwards.  The one who took the jump is said to have been chased by a wild ox, which pushed him over the hill, and if he had not been a man of steady eye and limb, the fall would have ended in sure destruction.  The place where he leapt was a ledge in the face of a precipice where the slightest over-balance or weakness, would have precipitated him several hundred feet into a dangerous and deep sea.  No trained tight-rope dancer ever required more sureness of eye or limb than must have been brought into action in this leap.\r\n\r\nIn the top of the same hill (Kenavara) there is a well, Briuthainn\u2019s Well  (Tobar Mhic-a-Bhriuthainn), which is said to have its name from the first who came to the island having, in his wanderings, subsisted on its water and wild water-cress",

He had been tipped off about a recent burial in Soroby graveyard and sailed accross to Tiree, beaching his boat here. He went accross the beach and they started digging the grave. They were seen by the grandfather of Anna Chiorstaidh Ghobhainn (Kennedy), Balinoe, and they tried to catch him to kill him. He escaped by clinging to the beams under the old wooden bridge at Balinoe. The pursuers looked on top of the bridge and under it but failed to see him. The Mull men then ran away.

In September 1854 [John] MacFarlane [the local pastor] was able to report progress to the Baptist Home Missionary Society for Scotland as follows:\r\n'The wall of our chapel is finished, and I trust the roof will be on in the course of a fortnight or so. The size of it is forty feet by about twenty four. It will seat about 300 people.'\r\nHe explained that the cost of erecting the new chapel was met by subscriptions and voluntary labour:\r\n'We have subscribed \u00a340 in this island itself, besides the quarrying and driving of the stones by the people gratis, the cost which would come to another \u00a340.'\r\nWhen the building was complete MacFarlane found that it was still not big enough:\r\n'Our chapel, though it seats about twice as many as the old meeting house, is by far too small to contain all the people on fine Sabbaths....We are grieved that, as the chapel cost us so much, we did not make it larger.'\" Donald E Meek, Island Harvest, Tirree Books, 1988, p12.",

        "stories":"Extract from \u2018Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition V. Argyllshire Series\u2019 Collected from Oral Sources by the Late Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, Minister of Tiree, Selected from the Author\u2019s MS. Remains, and Edited by Jessie Wallace and Duncan MacIssac, with Introducation by Alfred Nutt. (London; David Nutt, 1895)\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree at the present day are called Brunaich, sing.  Brunach, evidently a word not of a native origin, and likely and adaption of the English Brown.  Brown as the name of a colour is an English word but not Gaelic, the Gaelic for it being donn, hence as a clan name many affirm that the Brown of the present day is a corruption or modification of Bruthainn certainly the older name, and till very recently, the name given to sept or portion of the Browns.  There are also many who maintain the oldest form of all is Mac \u2013\u2019ill-duinn.\r\n\r\nOther explanations are also put forward in behalf of the origin of the name, but none of them are satisfactorily conclusive.  The following story of how the Browns came first to Tiree is a tradition as like to be true as any other.  It was heard from a native of the island, well acquainted with the traditions of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe wife of MacLean of Dowart was a daughter of the Lord of the Isles Her father on visiting her at Aros has found her destitute of table-linen, and on her being spoken to on the subject, she said that there was no place on the estate where lint could be grown.  Her father then gave her the island of Tiree as a good flax-growing country, then she might not be open to that reproach any longer.  In this way the island of Tiree remained in the possession of the Dowart family till the forfeiture of the clan towards the end of the seventeenth century.  The MacLeans seem to have ruled the island with a rod of iron.  There is still shewn the hillock called the Bank of the Gallows (Bac na Croiche), where the man who came in last with his rent at collection time was hanged.  A party of strong men called \u2018MacLean\u2019s attributes\u2019 (buaidheanan Mhic-\u2019illeathain) but more correctly oppressors and bullies, were kept in the island to overawe the people.\r\n\r\nThis wife of Dowart, with her galley and men, was at Croig in Mull, awaiting for a passage across to Tiree.  When teh men were getting the galley in order, a big strong man was observed making his way to the boat, His appearance was that of a beggar, with tattered and patched garments (l\u00f9irichean). He quietly asked to be allowed a passage with them.  The master of the boat gruffly refused, saying, that they would not allow one like him to be in the same boat with their mistress, but the beggar said that his being there would make no difference, and asked the favour of getting a passage from her.  She gave him permission and he seated himself at the end of the boat furthest from her to avoid giving trouble to her.  The day was becoming boisterous; it was not long till the master said that the wind was becoming to high, and the day unlikely.  A heavy sea was shipped wetting the Lady of Dowart, and the beggar said to the master, \u201cCan you do better?\u201d  The beggar replied \u201cIt would not be difficult for me to do better than that at any rate.  Show me the direction where you wish to go,\u201d and on it being shewn to him he added \u201cI think you may go on that you will make land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d the other said, \u201cit is none of your business to speak here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lady then spoke, and said to the beggar, \u201cWill you take the boat there if you get the command of it?\u201d  He said he would, and she gave orders to let him have the command.  He sat at the helm and told them to shorten sail, and make everything taut, and now, the boat did not take in a thimbleful of water.  They made for Tiree, and the place come to was the lower part of Hynish, at the furthest extremity of the island.  The first place of shelter which the beggar saw, he let the boat in there.  The little cove is still known as the Port of the Galley (Port-na-Birlinn) on the south side of Barradhu where the present dwellings belonging to the Skerryvore Lighthouse are.  The company landed safely, and on parting the Lady of Dowart told the beggar man to come to see her at Island House, where the residence of the Dowart family was at that time, and which is still the proprietory residence of the island.  The name Island House is derived from its present site having been formerly surrounded by the water of the fresh water lake near it.  It communicated with the rest of the island by means of a draw-bridge, but there being now no necessity for this safeguard the space between the house and the shore has been filled up, and the moated grange has become like ordinary dwelling houses.  The stranger wandered about for some time, and then went to the Island House and was kindly received.  After a day or two, he thought it would be better to get a house for himself, and the Lady of Dowart said that she would give him any place that he himself would fix upon.  Apparently the island was not much tenanted then, and according to the custom of the time, he got a horse with a pack-saddle on, and on the ridge of the saddle (cairb na srathach), he put the upper and lower stones of a quern (br\u00e0thainn), one on each side of the horse, secured by a straw or sea-bent rope, and wherever the rope broke it was lucky to build the house there.  The beggar-man\u2019s quern fell at Sunny Spot (Grianal), now better known as Greenhill.  He built a bothy there, and a woman came to keep house for him.  By her he had a son, whom he would not acknowledge.  When the child was able to take care of itself she went again to him with it that she might be free.  He still refused to receive the child and told her to avoid him.  She then thought as she had heard from him before where he came from, that she would go with her son to his relatives in Ireland.  When she arrived there the child\u2019s grandfather received her very kindly.  She stayed with him till her son had grown to manhood (gus an robh e \u2019na l\u00e0n duine). As she was about to return the grand-father said to his grandson, \u201cWhich do you now prefer, to follow your mother, or stay with me?\u201d  The lad said he would rather follow his mother, and risk his fortune along with her.  They came back to Tiree again, and the son would give no rest till they went to see his father.  When they reached the bothy the mother said \u201cyou will surely receive your son to-day though you would not acknowledge him before.\u201d  But he would not any more than at first.  His son then took hold of him, and putting his knee on his breast, said, \u201cbefore you rise from there you will own me as your son, and my mother as your married wife.\u201d  He did this and was set free.  They then lived together and built a house, and houses, and increased in stock of cattle.  One wild evening in spring, when they were folding the cattle, they observed a stout looking man of mean appearance coming from Kilkenneth, still a township in that part of the island, and making straight for the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw a bigger man than that beggar,\u201d said the son.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is big,\u201d the father said, \u201cI well know what man it is; he is coming after me, and I will lose my life this night, I killed his brother, but it was not my fault, for if I had not killed him, he would have killed me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will not lose your life to-night yet,\u201d said the son, \u201cbe kind to him, and when he has warmed himself, ask him to go out with us to kill a cow, for the night is cold.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger came in and was made welcome.  The old man then said since there was a stranger, and the night chill, they better take a cow and kill it.  They went out and brought in the cow.  The young-man said to the stranger, \u201cWhich would you rather, take the axe, or hold the cow\u2019s horn.?\u201d (Co dhiu b\u2019 fhearr leis an tuath ne\u2019n adharc). The stranger chose to hold the horn, and blow by which the beast was felled was so sudden and unexpected that the stranger fell with it.  The youth immediately fell upon him and kept him down, saying, \u201cYou will only have what you can do for yourself, till you tell why you came here to-night (Cha bhi agad ach na bheir thu g\u2019a chionns gus an aidich thu \u2019de thug so an nochd thu). He told word for word how he came to avenge his brother\u2019s death. (Dh\u2019 innis e facal air an fhacal mar thainig e thoirt mach \u00e8irig a br\u00e0thair).\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not leave this alive\u201d said the young man, \u201cuntil you promise not to molest my father while you remain in the country.\u201d  The stranger vowed, if released he would not offend anyone.  He was allowed to remain and they passed the night cheerfully and peacefully (gu sona s\u00e0mhach). The stranger returned the way he came.  The father and son then settled together, and are said according to tradition, to have been the first Browns in Tiree.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story is, that the first settler in Greenhill was a Campbell, and that he was the maker of those underground dwellings (tighean falaich) which still exist on that farm; curious habitations, which are unlike any building now in use, and worthy of closer examination by antiquarians.  It is said that there are buildings with similar entrances exposed by sand blowing and covered with a great depth of earth in Tra-vi at the distance of two miles or more further south.\r\n\r\nThere is a precipice on the west side of Kenavara hill called Mac-a-Bhriuthainn\u2019s leap (Leum Mhic-a-bhriuthainn) which one of this sept of Browns is said to have jumped across backwards, and which no one has since jumped either backwards or forwards.  The one who took the jump is said to have been chased by a wild ox, which pushed him over the hill, and if he had not been a man of steady eye and limb, the fall would have ended in sure destruction.  The place where he leapt was a ledge in the face of a precipice where the slightest over-balance or weakness, would have precipitated him several hundred feet into a dangerous and deep sea.  No trained tight-rope dancer ever required more sureness of eye or limb than must have been brought into action in this leap.\r\n\r\nIn the top of the same hill (Kenavara) there is a well, Briuthainn\u2019s Well  (Tobar Mhic-a-Bhriuthainn), which is said to have its name from the first who came to the island having, in his wanderings, subsisted on its water and wild water-cress.",

In this house a servant-man from Mull was sent to sleep.  Through the night he was disturbed by his dog jumping into bed between him and the wall and, with its fore-feet resting upon his body, snarling fiercely at something he could not see.  He heard feeble voices through the house saying, \u201cThis is the stone that was at my head.\u201d\r\n\r\nNothing more came of this visit of the spirits than that the Mull man (who was likely the victim of a hoax) positively refused to sleep in that house again. \r\n\r\np511:Footnote 896: \u2018The Burial-Place of the Big Women\u2019 is presumably Cladh nam Ban M\u00f2ra.  It probably refers to nuns \u2013 \u2018great women\u2019 rather than \u2018big women\u2019?  Niall M. Brownlie has not heard the name, but tells me that he thinks it may be identified with the Cladh Beag, of which Sands says (1881-82, p. 463): \u201cAt Hynish there is a meadow still called the Cladh beag, or little burial ground, where a chapel once stood; but the last farmer was a practical man, and used the church and tombstones to build stables and byres with.  A stone with a cross on it is still to be seen forming part of the pavement at the farm-steading.  On digging I discovered some of the mortar and stones of this ancient chapel.\u201d ...

Everywhere it was deemed unlucky among seafaring men to whistle in case a storm should arise.  In Tiree, Heynish Hill (the Highest in the island) was known as a\u2019 Bhraonach, Hogh Hill (the next highest) as a\u2019 Bheinn Bhe\u00e0rnach no Sgoilte (the Notched or Cloven Hill), and a species of whale as cas na poite (the leg of a pot).  It should not be said bh\u00e0thadh e \u2018he was drowned\u2019 but shiubhail e \u2018he journeyed\u2019, not ceangail r\u00f2p \u2018tie a rope\u2019 but dean e \u2018make it\u2019.  In the north it was held that an otter, while in its den, should not be valled besit dubh (the \u2018black beast\u2019, its common name), but c\u00e0rnag.  It would otherwise be impossible for the terriers to drive it from its refuge.\r\nFootnote 430; A\u2019 Bhraonach is \u2018the showery\/drizzly\/dewy female\u2019 (because of the tendency of Heynish Hill to attract cloud).  Beinn Hough, JGC\u2019s \u2018Hogh Hill\u2019, is from Norse haugr \u2018burial place\u2019 (there are Viking graves there). (This is only part of the footnote)\r\n\r\nPage 45\r\nKindness To A Neglected Child\r\nThe Elves sometimes took care of neglected children.  Te her who tendered the Balephuill cattle on Heynish Hill sat down one day on a green eminence (cnoc) in the hill which had the reputation of being tenanted by the Fairies.  His son, a young child, was along with him.  \r\n\tHe fell asleep, and he awoke the child was away.  He roused himself, and vowed aloud that unless his boy was restored he would not leave a stone or clod of the hillock together.  \r\n\tA voice from underground answered that the child was safe at home with its mother, and they (the \u2018people\u2019) had taken it lest it should come to harm with the cold.",

        "stories":"Extract taken from \u2018Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition V' Argyllshire Series Initiated and Directed by Lord Archibald Campell. Selected from the Author\u2019s MS Remains, and Edited by Jessie Wallace and Duncan MacIsaac, with introducation by Alfred Nutt:\r\n\r\nBrowns of Tiree\r\n\r\n(Clann a-Bhruthain).\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree at the present day are called Brunaich, sing.  Brunach, evidently a word not of a native origin, and likely and adaption of the English Brown.  Brown as the name of a colour is an English word but not Gaelic, the Gaelic for it being donn, hence as a clan name many affirm that the Brown of the present day is a corruption or modification of Bruthainn certainly the older name, and till very recently, the name given to sept or portion of the Browns.  There are also many who maintain the oldest form of all is Mac \u2013\u2019ill-duinn.\r\n\r\nOther explanations are also put forward in behalf of the origin of the name, but none of them are satisfactorily conclusive.  The following story of how the Browns came first to Tiree is a tradition as like to be true as any other.  It was heard from a native of the island, well acquainted with the traditions of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe wife of MacLean of Dowart was a daughter of the Lord of the Isles Her father on visiting her at Aros has found her destitute of table-linen, and on her being spoken to on the subject, she said that there was no place on the estate where lint could be grown.  Her father then gave her the island of Tiree as a good flax-growing country, then she might not be open to that reproach any longer.  In this way the island of Tiree remained in the possession of the Dowart family till the forfeiture of the clan towards the end of the seventeenth century.  The MacLeans seem to have ruled the island with a rod of iron.  There is still shewn the hillock called the Bank of the Gallows (Bac na Croiche), where the man who came in last with his rent at collection time was hanged.  A party of strong men called \u2018MacLean\u2019s attributes\u2019 (buaidheanan Mhic-\u2019illeathain) but more correctly oppressors and bullies, were kept in the island to overawe the people.\r\n\r\nThis wife of Dowart, with her galley and men, was at Croig in Mull, awaiting for a passage across to Tiree.  When teh men were getting the galley in order, a big strong man was observed making his way to the boat, His appearance was that of a beggar, with tattered and patched garments (l\u00f9irichean). He quietly asked to be allowed a passage with them.  The master of the boat gruffly refused, saying, that they would not allow one like him to be in the same boat with their mistress, but the beggar said that his being there would make no difference, and asked the favour of getting a passage from her.  She gave him permission and he seated himself at the end of the boat furthest from her to avoid giving trouble to her.  The day was becoming boisterous; it was not long till the master said that the wind was becoming to high, and the day unlikely.  A heavy sea was shipped wetting the Lady of Dowart, and the beggar said to the master, \u201cCan you do better?\u201d  The beggar replied \u201cIt would not be difficult for me to do better than that at any rate.  Show me the direction where you wish to go,\u201d and on it being shewn to him he added \u201cI think you may go on that you will make land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d the other said, \u201cit is none of your business to speak here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lady then spoke, and said to the beggar, \u201c Will you take the boat there if you get the command of it?\u201d  He said he would, and she gave orders to let him have the command.  He sat at the helm and told them to shorten sail, and make everything taut, and now, the boat did not take in a thimbleful of water.  They made for Tiree, and the place come to was the lower part of Hynish, at the furthest extremity of the island.  The first place of shelter which the beggar saw, he let the boat in there.  The little cove is still known as the Port of the Galley (Port-na-Birlinn) on the south side of Barradhu where the present dwellings belonging to the Skerryvore Lighthouse are.  The company landed safely, and on parting the Lady of Dowart told the beggar man to come to see her at Island House, where the residence of the Dowart family was at that time, and which is still the proprietary residence of the island.  The name Island House is derived from its present site having been formerly surrounded by the water of the fresh water lake near it.  It communicated with the rest of the island by means of a draw-bridge, but there being now no necessity for this safeguard the space between the house and the shore has been filled up, and the moated grange has become like ordinary dwelling houses.  The stranger wandered about for some time, and then went to the Island House and was kindly received.  After a day or two, he thought it would be better to get a house for himself, and the Lady of Dowart said that she would give him any place that he himself would fix upon.  Apparently the island was not much tenanted then, and according to the custom of the time, he got a horse with a pack-saddle on, and on the ridge of the saddle (cairb na srathach), he put the upper and lower stones of a quern (br\u00e0thainn), one on each side of the horse, secured by a straw or sea-bent rope, and wherever the rope broke it was lucky to build the house there.  The beggar-man\u2019s quern fell at Sunny Spot (Grianal), now better known as Greenhill.  He built a bothy there, and a woman came to keep house for him.  By her he had a son, whom he would not acknowledge.  When the child was able to take care of itself she went again to him with it that she might be free.  He still refused to receive the child and told her to avoid him.  She then thought as she had heard from him before where he came from, that she would go with her son to his relatives in Ireland.  When she arrived there the child\u2019s grandfather received her very kindly.  She stayed with him till her son had grown to manhood (gus an robh e \u2019na l\u00e0n duine). As she was about to return the grand-father said to his grandson, \u201c Which do you now prefer, to follow your mother, or stay with me?\u201d  The lad said he would rather follow his mother, and risk his fortune along with her.  They came back to Tiree again, and the son would give no rest till they went to see his father.  When they reached the bothy the mother said \u201cyou will surely receive your son to-day though you would not acknowledge him before.\u201d  But he would not any more than at first.  His son then took hold of him, and putting his knee on his breast, said, \u201cbefore you rise from there you will own me as your son, and my mother as your married wife.\u201d  He did this and was set free.  They then lived together and built a house, and houses, and increased in stock of cattle.  One wild evening in spring, when they were folding the cattle, they observed a stout looking man of mean appearance coming from Kilkenneth, still a township in that part of the island, and making straight for the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw a bigger man than that beggar,\u201d said the son.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is big,\u201d the father said, \u201c I well know what man it is; he is coming after me, and I will lose my life this night, I killed his brother, but it was not my fault, for if I had not killed him, he would have killed me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will not lose your life to-night yet,\u201d said the son, \u201cbe kind to him, and when he has warmed himself, ask him to go out with us to kill a cow, for the night is cold.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger came in and was made welcome.  The old man then said since there was a stranger, and the night chill, they better take a cow and kill it.  They went out and brought in the cow.  The young-man said to the stranger, \u201cWhich would you rather, take the axe, or hold the cow\u2019s horn.?\u201d (Co dhiu b\u2019 fhearr leis an tuath ne\u2019n adharc). The stranger chose to hold the horn, and blow by which the beast was felled was so sudden and unexpected that the stranger fell with it.  The youth immediately fell upon him and kept him down, saying, \u201cYou will only have what you can do for yourself, till you tell why you came here to-night (Cha bhi agad ach nab heir thu g\u2019a chionns gus an aidich thu \u2019de thug so an nochd thu). He told word for word how he came to avenge his brother\u2019s death. (Dh\u2019 innis e facal air an fhacal mar thainig e thoirt mach \u00e8irig a br\u00e0thair).\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not leave this alive\u201d said the young man, \u201cuntil you promise not to molest my father while you remain in the country.\u201d  The stranger vowed, if released he would not offend anyone.  He was allowed to remain and they passed the night cheerfully and peacefully (gu sona s\u00e0mhach). The stranger returned the way he came.  The father and son then settled together, and are said according to tradition, to have been the first Browns in Tiree.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story is, that the first settler in Greenhill was a Campbell, and that he was the maker of those underground dwellings (tighean falaich) which still exist on that farm; curious habitations, which are unlike any building now in use, and worthy of closer examination by antiquarians.  It is said that there are buildings with similar entrances exposed by sand blowing and covered with a great depth of earth in Tra-vi at the distance of two miles or more further south.\r\n\r\nThere is a precipice on the west side of Kenavara hill called Mac-a-Bhriuthainn\u2019s leap (Leum Mhic-a-bhriuthainn) which one of this sept of Browns is said to have jumped across backwards, and which no one has since jumped either backwards or forwards.  The one who took the jump is said to have been chased by a wild ox, which pushed him over the hill, and if he had not been a man of steady eye and limb, the fall would have ended in sure destruction.  The place where he leapt was a ledge in the face of a precipice where the slightest over-balance or weakness, would have precipitated him several hundred feet into a dangerous and deep sea.  No trained tight-rope dancer ever required more sureness of eye or limb than must have been brought into action in this leap.\r\n\r\nIn the top of the same hill (Kenavara) there is a well, Briuthainn\u2019s Well  (Tobar Mhic-a-Bhriuthainn), which is said to have its name from the first who came to the island having, in his wanderings, subsisted on its water and wild water-cress.",

In former days a family resided, or was out at the summer shielings, near this fort.  The byre in which the milch cows were kept was some distance from the dwelling-house, and two boys of the family slept there to take care of the cows.  One night a voice came to the mother of the family that the two best calves in the byre were at the point of death, and as proof of the warning, she would find the big yellow cow dead at the end of the house.  This proved to be the case, and on reaching the byre the anxious woman found her two boys nearly frightened to death.  They said they heard Fairy dogs trampling and baying on the top of the house. \r\n\r\nFragment of poem related to Dun Shiadair: \r\n\r\nTha mo bhata-sa gun iarain\r\n'S bidh i bliadhna gun d\u00f2igh,\r\nO nach maireann nan Fiantach\r\nA dh' fhag an fhead air an \u00f2ir.\r\n[My boat is without iron, and it will be out of commission for a year.

He was awakened by a violent slap on the ear.  On rubbing his eyes and looking up, he saw a woman \u2013 the most beautiful he had ever seen \u2013 in a green dress, with a brooch fastening it at the neck, walking away from him.  She went westward and he followed her for some distance, but she vanished, he could not tell how.\" \r\n\r\np45:\r\nThe elves sometimes took care of neglected children. The herd who tended the Balephuil catttle on Hynish Hill sat down one day on a green eminence (cnoc) in the hill which had the reputation of being tenanted by Fairies. His son, a young child, was along with him. He fell asleep, and when he awoke the child was away. He roused himself, and vowed aloud that unless his boy was restored he would not leave a stone or turf of the hillock together.

        "stories":"The township\u2019s name seems easier than most - town of the pool, or mud as it is sometimes translated. \r\nWhat about Loch a\u2019 Phuill then? The oldest map we have dates from 1654. This has Loch Fuil and you do hear some people in the township calling it Loch Phuill rather than the commoner Loch a\u2019 Phuill. This loch has its own legend. On its north shore there is a ruin which Donald MacNeill (D\u00f2mhnall an T\u00e0illeir), who was brought up in the Land, called Tobhta na Cailliche Bheur, the ruined house of the old woman of Beare. This Cailleach appears in legends around Argyll and Ireland as what you might call the witch of the winter. The Tiree story goes that the old woman had a nearby well which she had to cover every night. One night she forgot to do this and the well overflowed and the result was Loch a\u2019 Phuill. And if you go to the display at Cruachan power station you will see exactly the same story about the same Cailleach, a well on Ben Cruachan and the formation of Loch Awe.\r\nDavid McClounnan, Balephuil, told me this rhyme. Chunnaic mi Loch a' Phuill mar thobar beag cruinn agus Sgeir Mh\u00f2r nan R\u00f2n fo e\u00f2rna breac gorm [I saw Loch a' Phuill as a small round well and Skerryvore covered with dappled green barley]. And Willie MacLean, Barrapol, told me the loch is generally a shallow one. But there is one area, called An Rabhagach, which he measured at 18 feet with a pole. The Gaelic dictionary Dwelly translates this as \u201cweeds growing at the bottom of water.\r\n Balephuil beach, Tr\u00e0igh Bh\u00ec, and the stream between the loch and the beach, Abhainn Bh\u00ec, are thought to take their name from an Irish saint, MoBh\u00ec who is said to have founded the monastery at Glasnevin, now part of Dublin, around 500 AD. There is also a church dedicated to him at Kilmovee, County Mayo, Ireland. In the 1960s and 70s the Tiree Baptist Church did their baptisms at the bridge by the modern pump house after damming the flow of water to make the water deeper.\r\nThere are two parts to the township. The Sliabh, a word usually used on Tiree for moor land, is actually a row of crofts down the small side road below Reagan\u2019s Golf Ball, as it was sometimes called when it was built. Going back a hundred years, Lachlan MacQuarrie took over the new sheep farm which combined both East and West Hynish.  He had come to Tiree as the estate\u2019s ground officer in Heylipol, but the 1871 Census shows him in Hynish as a farmer of 900 acres, and by 1881 he was farming 1200 acres and employing three men and one woman. He cleared the crofters from the west side of the farm and they were relocated around 1870 into a square of new houses, Am Bail\u2019 \u00d9r, the new town.\r\nAm Bail\u2019 \u00d9r was also sometimes called Bail\u2019 a' Ghr\u00e0is, the town of Grace, because of the number of inhabitants who had converted to the Baptist Church. But it was more commonly called Baile nam B\u00e0rd, the town of poets. D\u00f2mhnall Chaluim B\u00e0in, Donald Sinclair, told this story.\r\nOf course at one time this very township that we're in here, they were the wittiest people on the island of Tiree. And there were so many poets among them. There were sixteen poets in Balephuil at one time. But no wonder they were witty when they would sit together at night. A song was composed in five minutes. Aye, you would make your own verse, and I would make a verse and inside five minutes the song was completed. They were all poets. That's why Balephuil over there is called 'the town of the poets', Baile nam B\u00e0rd (see the Tobar an Dualchais website for more).\r\nTowards the sea is An Sr\u00e0id Ruadh, the red street, set out at the same time as the Bail\u2019 \u00d9r. At the beach end of this the artist Duncan MacGregor Whyte (1866-1953) from Oban built a studio. He had travelled in Canada and Australia as a young man and  when he was on the island in the summer he painted a number of Tiree scenes. He always wore a kilt and was a great enthusiast for Gaelic. One evening he was ceilidhing in Taigh a\u2019 Ghreusaiche, the house of the shoemaker, and whenever someone used an English word he would tell them off. He was telling a story himself containing the phrase \u201cGhabh i cupa ti\u201d [she took a cup of tea]. Niall Eachainn MacDonald from the Sliabh, said, quick as a flash, \u201cBu choir dhuit s\u00f9gh duilleagan Insinneach ag radh\u201d [you should say the juice of the leaves of India].\r\nA favourite spot for many in the township is a hollow on the east side of Ben Hynish called Glac nan Smeur, the hollow of the berries. Honeysuckle, wild roses and dwarf willows grow in the shelter of the hill. It is the first place in spring on Tiree where you will hear the cuckoo calling. At its foot is a curious square of hawthorn trees, now almost dead from old age. A number of sources say that it was used for preaching at one time, and even St Columba is said to have used it. The factor McLaurin was also said to have had a house there. These \u2018trees\u2019 have given rise to the name of the field below them, P\u00e0irc na Coille, the field of the forest. \r\nTantalisingly, part of the boundary wall between Balemartine and Balephuil next to this is called G\u00e0rradh Shorobaidh, the boundary of Soroby. Who may well have had his monastery at Soroby? St Columba. But that\u2019s enough speculation about Irish saints!\r\n                                                                                                                                                    Dr John Holliday.\r\n\r\nVarious theories have been put forward as to the derivation of the name Baile Phuill, none of which can be regarded with any degree of credence. Where such a poll (genitive puill), or mire or marsh, actually was is very much open to speculation, and it is hardly credible that this township should have more poll or mud than any other in Tiree that it should be named after such a phenomenon! One is tempted to come to the conclusion that Baile Phuill was originally a name from Old Norse which has received a Gaelic complexion which conveniently falls in with the numerous other baile names throughout the western half of the island. Could it be that Baile Phuill, which would appear to be semantically unintelligible, is actually the Old Norse name of the adjacent township of Barrapol with a Gaelic \u201cdressing up\u201d? It is also of note that Balephuil Bay was in former times known as Barrapol Bay. The spelling of Baile Phuilll is preferable to Bail\u2019 a\u2019 Phuill as it tallies with Loch Phuill as it is heard in local pronunciation (not Loch a\u2019 Phuill). Again Loch Phuill does not ring true with Gaelic nomenclature which, all in all, points to a non-Gaelic derivation for the names Baile Phuill and Loch Phuill. Ailean Boyd, 1\/2012.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic Otherworld, ed Ronald Black, Birlinn, p 42 (and 41):\r\n\r\nFairies Stealing women and Children\r\nThe machair (or links) adjoining the hill of Kennavara, the extreme south-west point of Tiree, is after sunset one of the most solitary and weird places conceivable.  The hill on its northern side, facing Skerryvore lighthouse twelve miles off, consistes of precipices descending sheer down for upwards of a hundred feet, with frightful chasms where countless sea-birds make their nests, and at the base of which the Atlantic rolls with an incessant noise, which becomes deafening in bad weather.  The hill juts into the sea, and the coast, from each side of its inner end, trends away in beaches which \u2013 like all the beaches on the island \u2013 have after nightfall, from their whiteness and loneliness, a strange and ghostly look.\r\n\tOn the landward side, the level country stretches in a low dark line towards the horizon; little is to be seen, and the stillness is unbroken, save by the sound of the surf rolling on the beach and thundering in the chasms of the hill.  It is not, therefore, wonderful that these links should be haunted by the Fairies, or the timid wayfarer there meet the big black Elfin dog prowling among the sand-banks, hear its unearthly baying in the stormy night wind, and in the uncertain light and the squattering of wildfowl, hear in the wintry pools the banshi washing the garments of those soon to die.\r\n\tSome seventy or eighty years ago the herdsman who had charge of the cattle on this pasture went to a marriage in the neighbouring village of Balephuil (\u2018Mud-town\u2019), leaving his mother and a young child alone in the house.  The night was wild and stormy; there was heavy rain, and every pool and stream was more than ordinarily swollen.  His mother sat waiting his return, and two women \u2013 whom she knew to be Fairies \u2013 came to steal the child.\r\n\tThe stood between the outer and inner doors and were so tall their heads appeared above the partition beam.  One was taller than the other.  They were accompanied by a dog, and stood one on each side, having a hold of an ear and scratching it.  Some say there was a crowd of \u2018little people\u2019 behind to assist in taking the child away.  For security the woman placed it between herself and the fire, but her precautions were not quite successful.  From that night the child was slightly fatuous, \u2018a half idiot\u2019 (leth \u00f2inseach).  The old woman, it is said, had second sight.\r\n\r\nPage 45\r\nKindness To A Neglected Child\r\nThe Elves sometimes took care of neglected children.  Te her who tendered the Balephuill cattle on Heynish Hill sat down one day on a green eminence (cnoc) in the hill which had the reputation of being tenanted by the Fairies.  His son, a young child, was along with him.  \r\n\tHe fell asleep, and he awoke the child was away.  He roused himself, and vowed aloud that unless his boy was restored he would not leave a stone or clod of the hillock together.  \r\n\tA voice from underground answered that the child was safe at home with its mother, and they (the \u2018people\u2019) had taken it lest it should come to harm with the cold.\r\n\r\nPage 56\r\nA herdsman at Balephuill, in the west end of Tiree, fell asleep on Cnoc Ghrianal, at the eastern base of Heynish Hill, on a fine summer afternoon.  He was awakened by a violent slap on the ear.  On rubbing his eyes and looking up, he saw a woman \u2013 the most beautiful he had ever seen \u2013 in a green dress, with a brooch fastening it at the neck, walking away from him.  She went westward and he followed her for some distance, but she vanished, he could not tell how.\r\n\r\nPage 71\r\nA strong man named Dugald Campbell was one night, about the end of last century, watching the cattle on the farm of Baile Phuill, in the west of Tiree. (Not 230)  A little red cow came among the herd and was attacked by other cows.   It fled and they followed.  Dugald also set off in pursuit.  Sometimes the little red cow seemed near, sometimes far away.  At last it entered the face of a rock, and one of the other cows followed and was never again seen.  The whole herd would have followed had not Dugald intercepted them.",

        "stories":"Here\u2019s a problem. People give names to a place. For the 10 000 years we have been walking Tiree we have named rocks, pools and streams. These place names allow us to tell other people what happened where. And the more important an area is to us, the more names it carries. So how come the wildest corner of the island - the place we go to get away from it all, and stare out across the heaving Atlantic - has more place names, and more old place names, than anywhere else on Tiree?\r\nThere are 130 place names on Kenavara, particularly around the western cliffs. Many of these names are from Viking times, so it\u2019s clear that these inaccessible rocks have been important to humans for at least a thousand years. And a rich deposit of worked flints at its base shows that the area was used for nine thousand years before that.\r\nOf course the promontory provided a large area of hill grazing, and the shepherds of Barrapol and Middleton had a trying time rescuing sheep stuck on its western rock ledges. David McClounnan and Willie MacLean both told me of using a rope to rescue ewes stuck in Poll Dubh nan Caoraich, the black pool of the sheep, half way down one of the rock faces. \r\nAnd there are some important fishing points at the base of the cliffs - although I don\u2019t know if there is anyone alive today who could take you safely down to them. Carraig nan Gillean, the fishing rock of the boys, is named after three lads who were drowned there by a freak wave.\r\nBut I have another theory: birds. On the towering cliffs of Suduroy in the Faroes, islanders used to be lowered on ropes to collect eggs, and the guillemots and gannets which nest there. And these rock faces are covered with over a hundred place names. \u201cPoles were hammered into the ground and the fowler was fastened to the rope by a special saddle-formed seat. One or two men would give out the rope while a man placed at the very edge of the cliff observed the descent, giving orders to the rope man\u2026The eggs were placed in sheep hide bag.\u201d Birds were also caught. \u201cThe average catch was estimated at 55 000 guillemots a year.\u201d\r\nSloc mhic Fhionnlaigh, the crevice of the son of Finlay, is a huge fissure in the cliff face. If you lie carefully at the top you get a dizzying view of the seabirds wheeling in front of you. [Warning: cliffs can seriously damage your health. Don\u2019t do this on your own]. A ledge on the rocks there is called Uirigh nam Br\u00f2g, the shelf of the shoes. Willie MacLean told me that this was where climbers would take off their boots before tackling the cliffs.\r\nA more recent name for Sloc mhic Fhionnlaigh is Sloc mhic St\u00ecoraidh, the crevice of the son of \u2018Steery\u2019. Some boys were hunting for eggs here around 1890, including Hector, Archie and Neil Lamont from Balemartine, whose father had the nickname St\u00ecoraidh. One of the boys slipped and fell two hundred feet down the vertical cliff, but miraculously landed on a bed of seaweed and survived. The other boys ran to get help and Iain Campbell, Barrapol, Annie Brown\u2019s father, returned with them to the cliffs with some rope. The boy was stuck to his waist but they managed to haul him to safety.\r\nAnd here\u2019s another problem. How should we spell Kenavara? Ceann a\u2019 Mhara, the headland of the sea? Ceann a\u2019 Bhara? There has been surprisingly little agreement over the years, which is why the Kenavara version is still widely used: at least you can see how it should be pronounced. The Old Statistical Account of 1791 describes it as the \u201chill of Ceanmharra.\u201d The original Ordnance Survey recorded Ceann-a-Bharra (with \u201cmeaning undecided\u201d) but then the first OS map in the 1870s gave it as Ceann a\u2019 Mhara. The first part is easy: Ceann, a headland. But the Gaelic word for sea, muir, is usually feminine and so this last meaning would usually give Ceann na Mara. And calling an important promontory \u2018Headland of the Sea\u2019 doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\r\nKenavara, as a name for the whole headland is probably relatively recent. The Vikings called it Kirk-nis, church promontory, because of St Patrick\u2019s chapel, and the hill used to be called Ben Skarabrig, the hill of the fort of the cormorants.\r\nThe clue, I think, is in a small group of houses nestling in the Barrapol sand dunes, recorded in 1716 as Kenavarr, and in a Rental of 1747 as Kenvar. It surely is no coincidence that the neighbouring township is Barrapol. \u2018Barapole and Kenovar\u2019 were rented together in one tack until 1800 when it was subdivided into 15 crofts. Kenovar here must mean the \u2018boundary (another meaning of the word ceann) of Barrapol\u2019. And the meaning of Barrapol? It\u2019s a Norse name: barra-, a grave mound, and \u2013bolstadr, a farm. That is why I use the form Ceann a\u2019 Bharra.\r\nDr John Holliday\r\n\r\n As you walk towards Tr\u00e0igh Bh\u00ec, Balephuil beach, from Barrapol you pass a row of stones in a hollow between the giant sand dunes. This is all that is left of the settlement of Kenvar. One of these ruins is Taigh a\u2019 Ch\u00ecobair, the house of the shepherd, also known as Taigh Iain Mhoireasdain, the house of Iain Morrison. John Gregorson Campbell was the minister on Tiree from 1861 to 1891. His passion was collecting traditional stories about the island, one of which is about this ruin.\r\n\r\nSome seventy or eighty years ago the herdsman who had charge of the cattle on this pasture [Ceann a\u2019 Bharra] went to a marriage in the neighbouring village of Balephuil, leaving his mother and a young child alone in the house. The night was wild and stormy; there was heavy rain, and every pool and stream was more than ordinarily swollen [it is easy to picture the scene this winter!] His mother sat waiting his return, and two women \u2013 whom she knew to be Fairies \u2013came to steal the child. They stood between the outer and inner doors and were so tall their heads appeared above the partition beam. One was taller than the other. They were accompanied by a dog, and stood one on each side, having a hold of an ear and scratching it. Some say there was a crowd of \u2018little people\u2019 behind to assist in taking the child away. For security the woman placed [the child] between herself and the fire, but her precautions were not quite successful. From that night the child was slightly fatuous, \u2018a half idiot\u2019 (leth \u00f2inseach).\r\n\r\nAt the Ceann a\u2019 Bharra end of Balephuil beach is Port a\u2019 Charbhanaich, the inlet of the bream. Hector Kennedy, Heylipol, told this story in 1957. The first Kennedy that came to Tiree, it was at Kenavara, in a boat. He was pursued by a cutter from Ireland, himself and Stefan [who we met in Kilkenneth \u2013 pay attention!] They landed at Port a\u2019 Charbhanaich. He married and his descendants are in the island still. Leading down to this inlet is the track Am Bealach Dubh, the black pass, where crofters took their carts collecting tangles.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Am Bealach Dubh is a stream and beyond this is a concrete slab, the site of Taigh Alison, Alison\u2019s house. At the base of the rocks nearby you can also still see clearly the well Tobar Alison, Alison\u2019s well. Henry Young Alison taught at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1930s and 40s and personally built the small staircase that leads to the balcony of the Mackintosh library in the Art School. He came to Tiree every summer and built two huts \u2013 one in Sandaig and another here under Ceann a\u2019 Bharra. He was often to be found fishing in his canoe, as well as painting and turning out for island\u2019s Home Guard. This was despite having lost the sight of one eye while a POW in the First World War. Inside the hut there was a row of cups hanging by the sink, and it became a game for some of the local boys to rock the hut backwards and forwards to try to dislodge them. To deter them Alison made a green figure and placed it on the rocks nearby, letting it be known that the place was haunted by the \u2018Green Woman\u2019.\r\nThe most famous landmark on Ceann a\u2019 Bharra is Teampall Ph\u00e0raig or St Patrick\u2019s Chapel. This small medieval church was built on the site of what is called an eremitic monastery, from the Greek word for wilderness, eremos. This monastery dates from the time of St Columba, around 700 AD. In this remote spot there are four or five platforms where monks lived in punishing conditions in stone cells, seeking by their isolation to be closer to God. It is said to have been built on the spot where Iona first comes into view past the headland of West Hynish. \r\nThe place still has a magical atmosphere and it was once also believed to be the home of fairies. Donald MacArthur, D\u00f2mhnall an t-Sl\u00e8ibh, Balephuil, was one who was said to have been held captive there. John MacLean, the Balemartine bard, wrote this verse about the site. \u2018An Teampall Ph\u00e0raig chualas farum \/ Ruidhleadh, aighear agus ce\u00f2l \/ S\u00ecthichean a seinn na pioba \/ Le toil-intinn thu bhi be\u00f2. A sound can be heard at St Patrick's Temple \/ Reels, joy and music \/ Fairies playing the pipes \/ You will live pleasurably.\r\nAnother of Campbell\u2019s stories illustrates this. Two children, a brother and sister, went on a moonlight winter\u2019s night to Kenavara Hill to look after a snare they had set for little birds, in a hollow near a stream. The ground was covered with snow, and when the two had descended into the hollow, they heard most beautiful music coming from underground, close to where they were standing. In the extremity of terror both fled. The boy went fastest, and never looked behind him. The girl was at first encumbered by her father\u2019s big shoes, which she had put on for the occasion, but, throwing them off, she reached home with a panting heart not long after her brother. The story was told by her when an old woman. She never forgot the fright the Fairy music gave her in childhood.\r\nLegend has it that St Patrick brought bracken to Tiree in the pockets of his clothes. Near the chapel is Dabhach Ph\u00e0raig, the vat of St Patrick. Donald Sinclair, West Hynish, told this story. It is a well, and the water must be coming from the rock. It is big, three feet in each dimension at its opening and it's as round as a water pipe. It is filled with stones today after a lamb drowned in it. But if you took the stones out and baled it dry, it would fill up again as full as ever. I heard a story from the time of my grandfather, whatever illness you had, if you went to Dabhach Ph\u00e0raig and tasted the water there in the name of the Lord, you would be cured.\r\n\r\nDr John Holliday \r\n\r\nBeyond the chapel is the corner of the headland which is now called Rinn Chircnis. This name comes from another Gaelic word for promontory, rinn, and the Norse name for promontory, nis, of the church, kirk \u2013 two promontories in two languages in one name! Beyond this is a shingly beach surrounded by steep slopes, Am Fang Dubh, the black cattle pen. In the middle of this there is the ruin of a small hut said to have been used by fishermen from the east end of the island. \r\n\r\nI have passed on the health warning that cliffs are bad for your health. Another height named after a tragedy is Sloc MhicCn\u00ecthaluim, the crack of the son of Cr\u00ecalum: the name goes back at least as far as the Turnbull map of 1768 where it appears as VickCrelim. David McClounnan told me this fissure in the cliffs was named after an old shepherd from Kilmoluaig. His daughter brought him lunch as usual in a wooden bowl, but he was never seen again and it was believed he had died as he climbed down the cliffs collecting eggs.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs and panoramic views make Ceann a\u2019 Bharra a good place to defend, and three Iron Age forts were built here. One is at the far end on a separate rock, almost an island, called variously Eilean na B\u00f2 M\u00f2ire, island of the big cow, Eilean nam B\u00e0, island of the cows, or Eilean nam B\u00e0thadh, island of the drowning. On the cliffs, and only accessible by a narrow ledge, is D\u00f9n nan Gall, fort of the strangers, while below it on a pinnacle of rock at the shore is D\u00f9n an Eilein Dhuibh, fort of the black island.\r\nAnd then there are the caves. We all like a good cave and Ceann a\u2019 Bharra has three. The least known and the furthest away is Uamh a\u2019 Mh\u00e8irlich, the cave of the thief. David McClounnan had this story about it. Four men were playing cards in a house in The Land, Barrapol, one night and Colin MacDonald (Cailean Fhearchair, \u201ca small chap. He could fit in a crack!\u201d) from the Bail\u2019 \u00d9r asked if anyone knew where Uamh a\u2019 Mh\u00e8irlich was. No one else did so he offered to show them the next day. It is hidden at the base of Uinneagan Beum a\u2019 Chlaidheimh [literally the windows of the stroke of the sword], a large gash down the side of Kenavara at a part called An D\u00f2rnach. In front of the cave there is a jumble of stones \u201cas though they\u2019ve been blasted.\u201d You have to crawl to get in. Inside, the cave is \u201cthe size of Saddam Hussein\u2019s cell,\u201d and they found a stone like a square table and three clay cups. \u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d asked Colin.  \r\nBelow D\u00f9n nan Gall are two more caves and I haven\u2019t quite worked out which stories and which names go with which. Uamh a\u2019 Ruith, or Uamh an Fhir Dhuibh, the cave of the black man or devil, is at the base of an inaccessible cliff. Hector Cameron\u2019s guide book states \u201cthere is no access to it except by means of a rope\u201d which looks pretty accurate to me!\r\n\r\nAn Uamh Mh\u00f2r, the big cave, is at the end of Druim nan Uan, ridge of the lambs, and can be reached if you are careful at low tide when the rocks are dry. It has a number of other names: Uamh an Fhuamaire, the cave of the giant, Uamh nan Calman, cave of the doves, or Uamh an \u00d2ir, the cave of gold. Niall Brownlie writes in his book Bailtean is Ath-Ghairmean: North of the fort is the Uamh Mh\u00f2r, a huge opening that penetrates far into the hill. In my young days it was often referred to as Uamh an \u00d2ir, and oral tradition maintains that it traverses the entire island. As a boy I heard my mother relate how a piper, accompanied by a dog, set out to traverse the Great Cave but was never seen again. When a neighbour went to the mouth of the cave in search of him, he found only the dog, still alive - but hairless from nose to tail. \"Without three hands - two for the pipes and one for the sword - no human will ever traverse the Cave of Gold, my mother would say most emphatically. Some versions of the story have the dog coming out at D\u00f9n M\u00f2r a\u2019 Chaolais above Milton and the sound of the pipes being heard at Druim na h-Uamha, the ridge of the cave in Scarinish.\r\n\r\nThis cave was also known as Uaimh Dhiarmaid, the cave of Diarmad, the ancient Irish hero. Just inside the entrance to the cave is a rock platform called Leabaidh Nighean R\u00ecgh Lochlainn, the bed of the daughter of the king of Norway. This probably relates to a 10th century Irish traditional story about C\u00fa Chulainn and Derbforgaill. We met this connection before in Balephetrish, where the old name for the Ringing Stone was Coire Fionn mac Chumhaill after the Irish Fenian hero, and it shows the influence of the Irish Gaels on Tiree.\r\n\r\nFinally, across the middle of Ceann a\u2019 Bharra lie the remains of a dyke known as Obair-l\u00e0 Chlann Mhurchaidh, the day\u2019s work of the family of Murdoch, a Campbell who lived in Kenvar. Niall Brownlie again. According to the story, Clann Mhurchaidh acquired some land in this area of Kenavara, and of a morning they set out to build a stone dyke around it. When twilight came they set off home, leaving their implements behind. When they returned in the morning the dyke had been completed by the fairies.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracts from 'The Gaelic Otherworld' by John Gregorson Campbell, Edited with commentary by Ronald Black, (Edinburgh; Birlinn, 2005) p41-2:\r\nThe machair (or links) adjoining the hill of Kennavara, the extreme south-west point of Tiree, is after sunset one of the most solitary and weird places conceivable.  The hill on its northern side, facing Skerryvore lighthouse twelve miles off, consists of precipices descending sheer down for upwards of a hundred feet, with frightful chasms where countless sea-birds make their nests, and at the base of which the Atlantic rolls with an incessant noise, which becomes deafening in bad weather.  The hill juts into the sea, and the coast, from each side of its inner end, trends away in beaches which \u2013 like all the beaches on the island \u2013 have after nightfall, from their whiteness and loneliness, a strange and ghostly look.\r\n\tOn the landward side, the level country stretches in a low dark line towards the horizon; little is to be seen, and the stillness is unbroken, save by the sound of the surf rolling on the beach and thundering in the chasms of the hill.  It is not, therefore, wonderful that these links should be haunted by the Fairies, or the timid wayfarer there meet the big black Elfin dog prowling among the sand-banks, hear its unearthly baying in the stormy night wind, and in the uncertain light and the squattering of wildfowl, hear in the wintry pools the banshi washing the garments of those soon to die.\r\n\tSome seventy or eighty years ago the herdsman who had charge of the cattle on this pasture went to a marriage in the neighbouring village of Balephuil (\u2018Mud-town\u2019), leaving his mother and a young child alone in the house.  The night was wild and stormy; there was heavy rain, and every pool and stream was more than ordinarily swollen.  His mother sat waiting his return, and two women \u2013 whom she knew to be Fairies \u2013 came to steal the child.\r\n\tThey stood between the outer and inner doors and were so tall their heads appeared above the partition beam.  One was taller than the other.  They were accompanied by a dog, and stood one on each side, having a hold of an ear and scratching it.  Some say there was a crowd of \u2018little people\u2019 behind to assist in taking the child away.  For security the woman placed it between herself and the fire, but her precautions were not quite successful.  From that night the child was slightly fatuous, \u2018a half idiot\u2019 (leth \u00f2inseach).  The old woman, it is said, had second sight (see Taigh a' Chiobair, Ceann a' Bharra).\r\n\r\np56:\r\nThe places in Tiree where cailleacha s\u00ecth (Fairy hags) were seen were at streams and pools of water on Druim Buidhe (\u2018the Yellow Back\u2019), and the links of Kennavara, and the bend of the hill (l\u00f9badh na beinne) at Baile Pheudrais.  They have long since disappeared, the islanders having become too busy to attend to them. (Footnote 193)\r\nFootnote 193: Niall M. Brownlie points out to me that Cnoc Ghrianal, properly Cnoc Ghrianail (Gaelic cnoc \u2018hillock\u2019, Norse groene \u2018green\u2019 and vollr field\u2019), is very close to a flat grassy area which may be the site of a chapel dedicated to St Mo-Bh\u00ec.  \u2018The Yellow Ridge,\u2019 an Druim Bhuidhe nowadays, is a stretch of desolate moorland on the west side of the Cornaig road, see note 941.\r\n\r\np73:\r\nTwo children, a brother and sister, went on a moonlight winter\u2019s night to Kennavara Hill to look after a snare they had set for little birds in a hollow near a stream.

She had never forgot the fright the Fairy music gave her in childhood.\r\n\r\np75:\r\nA man, coming across the links near Kenavara Hill in Tiree, came upon a large black dog resting on the side of a sandbank.  On observing it he turned aside and took another road home.  Next day he recovered courage and went to examine the spot.  He found on the sand the marks of a dog\u2019s paw as large as the spread of his palm.  He followed these huge footmarks till he lost them on the plain.  The dog had taken no notice of him, and he felt assured from its size it could be no earthly hound.\r\n\r\np180:\r\nA witch who left home every night was followed by her husband, who wondered what she could be about.  She became a cat, and went in the name of the devil to sea in a sieve with seven other cats.  The husband upset the sieve by naming the Trinity, and the witches were drowned.  So the Skye story runs. (Footnote 616)  In the Sound of Mull the witches went on boards the sieve \u2018against the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost,\u2019 and the husband upset the concern by putting his foot on board in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.\r\nIn Tiree the unfortunate women were passing Kennavara Hill in eggshells on their way to Ireland when the husband of one of them, seeing the fleet, wished them God-speed.  Instantly the eggshells sank, and the women were drowned.\r\n\r\np263:\r\nIn 1870 a ship struck on a sunken rock in the passages between the Skerryvore lighthouse and Tiree, and sprang a leak.  The shore was made for at once, but when within 150 yards of it the ship sank.  \r\nThe crew betook themselves to the rigging and were ultimately rescued; but the skipper, in trying to swim ashore, was caught by the current that sweeps round Kennavara Hill, and drowned.   The crying heard in Kennavara Hill four years previous was deemed to have portended this event (see Taigh Alasdair Neill Oig, Balephuil).",

Argyllshire Series\u2019 Collected from Oral Sources by the Late Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, Minister of Tiree, Selected from the Author\u2019s MS. Remains, and Edited by Jessie Wallace and Duncan MacIssac, with Introducation by Alfred Nutt. (London; David Nutt, 1895)\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree at the present day are called Brunaich, sing.  Brunach, evidently a word not of a native origin, and likely and adaption of the English Brown.  Brown as the name of a colour is an English word but not Gaelic, the Gaelic for it being donn, hence as a clan name many affirm that the Brown of the present day is a corruption or modification of Bruthainn certainly the older name, and till very recently, the name given to sept or portion of the Browns.  There are also many who maintain the oldest form of all is Mac \u2013\u2019ill-duinn.\r\n\r\nOther explanations are also put forward in behalf of the origin of the name, but none of them are satisfactorily conclusive.  The following story of how the Browns came first to Tiree is a tradition as like to be true as any other.  It was heard from a native of the island, well acquainted with the traditions of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe wife of MacLean of Dowart was a daughter of the Lord of the Isles Her father on visiting her at Aros has found her destitute of table-linen, and on her being spoken to on the subject, she said that there was no place on the estate where lint could be grown.  Her father then gave her the island of Tiree as a good flax-growing country, then she might not be open to that reproach any longer.  In this way the island of Tiree remained in the possession of the Dowart family till the forfeiture of the clan towards the end of the seventeenth century.  The MacLeans seem to have ruled the island with a rod of iron.  There is still shewn the hillock called the Bank of the Gallows (Bac na Croiche), where the man who came in last with his rent at collection time was hanged.  A party of strong men called \u2018MacLean\u2019s attributes\u2019 (buaidheanan Mhic-\u2019illeathain) but more correctly oppressors and bullies, were kept in the island to overawe the people.\r\n\r\nThis wife of Dowart, with her galley and men, was at Croig in Mull, awaiting for a passage across to Tiree.  When teh men were getting the galley in order, a big strong man was observed making his way to the boat, His appearance was that of a beggar, with tattered and patched garments (l\u00f9irichean). He quietly asked to be allowed a passage with them.  The master of the boat gruffly refused, saying, that they would not allow one like him to be in the same boat with their mistress, but the beggar said that his being there would make no difference, and asked the favour of getting a passage from her.  She gave him permission and he seated himself at the end of the boat furthest from her to avoid giving trouble to her.  The day was becoming boisterous; it was not long till the master said that the wind was becoming to high, and the day unlikely.  A heavy sea was shipped wetting the Lady of Dowart, and the beggar said to the master, \u201cCan you do better?\u201d  The beggar replied \u201cIt would not be difficult for me to do better than that at any rate.  Show me the direction where you wish to go,\u201d and on it being shewn to him he added \u201cI think you may go on that you will make land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d the other said, \u201cit is none of your business to speak here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lady then spoke, and said to the beggar, \u201cWill you take the boat there if you get the command of it?\u201d  He said he would, and she gave orders to let him have the command.  He sat at the helm and told them to shorten sail, and make everything taut, and now, the boat did not take in a thimbleful of water.  They made for Tiree, and the place come to was the lower part of Hynish, at the furthest extremity of the island.  The first place of shelter which the beggar saw, he let the boat in there.  The little cove is still known as the Port of the Galley (Port-na-Birlinn) on the south side of Barradhu where the present dwellings belonging to the Skerryvore Lighthouse are.  The company landed safely, and on parting the Lady of Dowart told the beggar man to come to see her at Island House, where the residence of the Dowart family was at that time, and which is still the proprietory residence of the island.  The name Island House is derived from its present site having been formerly surrounded by the water of the fresh water lake near it.  It communicated with the rest of the island by means of a draw-bridge, but there being now no necessity for this safeguard the space between the house and the shore has been filled up, and the moated grange has become like ordinary dwelling houses.  The stranger wandered about for some time, and then went to the Island House and was kindly received.  After a day or two, he thought it would be better to get a house for himself, and the Lady of Dowart said that she would give him any place that he himself would fix upon.  Apparently the island was not much tenanted then, and according to the custom of the time, he got a horse with a pack-saddle on, and on the ridge of the saddle (cairb na srathach), he put the upper and lower stones of a quern (br\u00e0thainn), one on each side of the horse, secured by a straw or sea-bent rope, and wherever the rope broke it was lucky to build the house there.  The beggar-man\u2019s quern fell at Sunny Spot (Grianal), now better known as Greenhill.  He built a bothy there, and a woman came to keep house for him.  By her he had a son, whom he would not acknowledge.  When the child was able to take care of itself she went again to him with it that she might be free.  He still refused to receive the child and told her to avoid him.  She then thought as she had heard from him before where he came from, that she would go with her son to his relatives in Ireland.  When she arrived there the child\u2019s grandfather received her very kindly.  She stayed with him till her son had grown to manhood (gus an robh e \u2019na l\u00e0n duine). As she was about to return the grand-father said to his grandson, \u201cWhich do you now prefer, to follow your mother, or stay with me?\u201d  The lad said he would rather follow his mother, and risk his fortune along with her.  They came back to Tiree again, and the son would give no rest till they went to see his father.  When they reached the bothy the mother said \u201cyou will surely receive your son to-day though you would not acknowledge him before.\u201d  But he would not any more than at first.  His son then took hold of him, and putting his knee on his breast, said, \u201cbefore you rise from there you will own me as your son, and my mother as your married wife.\u201d  He did this and was set free.  They then lived together and built a house, and houses, and increased in stock of cattle.  One wild evening in spring, when they were folding the cattle, they observed a stout looking man of mean appearance coming from Kilkenneth, still a township in that part of the island, and making straight for the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw a bigger man than that beggar,\u201d said the son.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is big,\u201d the father said, \u201cI well know what man it is; he is coming after me, and I will lose my life this night, I killed his brother, but it was not my fault, for if I had not killed him, he would have killed me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will not lose your life to-night yet,\u201d said the son, \u201cbe kind to him, and when he has warmed himself, ask him to go out with us to kill a cow, for the night is cold.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger came in and was made welcome.  The old man then said since there was a stranger, and the night chill, they better take a cow and kill it.  They went out and brought in the cow.  The young-man said to the stranger, \u201cWhich would you rather, take the axe, or hold the cow\u2019s horn.?\u201d (Co dhiu b\u2019 fhearr leis an tuath ne\u2019n adharc). The stranger chose to hold the horn, and blow by which the beast was felled was so sudden and unexpected that the stranger fell with it.  The youth immediately fell upon him and kept him down, saying, \u201cYou will only have what you can do for yourself, till you tell why you came here to-night (Cha bhi agad ach na bheir thu g\u2019a chionns gus an aidich thu \u2019de thug so an nochd thu). He told word for word how he came to avenge his brother\u2019s death. (Dh\u2019 innis e facal air an fhacal mar thainig e thoirt mach \u00e8irig a br\u00e0thair).\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not leave this alive\u201d said the young man, \u201cuntil you promise not to molest my father while you remain in the country.\u201d  The stranger vowed, if released he would not offend anyone.  He was allowed to remain and they passed the night cheerfully and peacefully (gu sona s\u00e0mhach). The stranger returned the way he came.  The father and son then settled together, and are said according to tradition, to have been the first Browns in Tiree.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story is, that the first settler in Greenhill was a Campbell, and that he was the maker of those underground dwellings (tighean falaich) which still exist on that farm; curious habitations, which are unlike any building now in use, and worthy of closer examination by antiquarians.  It is said that there are buildings with similar entrances exposed by sand blowing and covered with a great depth of earth in Tra-vi at the distance of two miles or more further south.\r\n\r\nThere is a precipice on the west side of Kenavara hill called Mac-a-Bhriuthainn\u2019s leap (Leum Mhic-a-bhriuthainn) which one of this sept of Browns is said to have jumped across backwards, and which no one has since jumped either backwards or forwards.  The one who took the jump is said to have been chased by a wild ox, which pushed him over the hill, and if he had not been a man of steady eye and limb, the fall would have ended in sure destruction.  The place where he leapt was a ledge in the face of a precipice where the slightest over-balance or weakness, would have precipitated him several hundred feet into a dangerous and deep sea.  No trained tight-rope dancer ever required more sureness of eye or limb than must have been brought into action in this leap.\r\n\r\nIn the top of the same hill (Kenavara) there is a well, Briuthainn\u2019s Well  (Tobar Mhic-a-Bhriuthainn), which is said to have its name from the first who came to the island having, in his wanderings, subsisted on its water and wild water-cress",

Two witches (cailleachan-sh\u00ec) came to the door, wanting the baby (\"cho dearg 's tha gruaidhean do leanaibh\" - how red your baby's cheeks are, they said). The mother drove them away with burning peat she held with iron tongs - David McClounnan, Balephuil, 2\/1996.\r\n\r\nBailtean is Ath-Ghairmean, Townships and Echoes by Niall M Brownlie, Argyll Publishing, 1995, p 72-4:\r\n\r\nUnder the shadow of Kenavara lay the old village of Barrapol, and a story is told about the spouse of Calum of Barrapol, who was head of the peasantry when Gorten Donald was a farm. On a winter's night when Calum was away from home, his wife was sitting bside the peat fire spinning when two strange-looking men eneterd the house. She realised immediately that they were hobgoblins, and that it was not out of kindness that they had come to visit. When they began to threaten her, she managed to keep them at bay until her husband returned and drove them off. Some seventy or eighty years ago [i.e around 1800] the herdsman who had charge of the cattle on this pasture went to a marriage in the neighbouring village of Balephuil (\u2018Mud-town\u2019), leaving his mother and a young child alone in the house.  The night was wild and stormy; there was heavy rain, and every pool and stream was more than ordinarily swollen.  His mother sat waiting his return, and two women \u2013 whom she knew to be Fairies \u2013 came to steal the child.\r\n\tThey stood between the outer and inner doors and were so tall their heads appeared above the partition beam.  One was taller than the other.  They were accompanied by a dog, and stood one on each side, having a hold of an ear and scratching it.  Some say there was a crowd of \u2018little people\u2019 behind to assist in taking the child away.  For security the woman placed it between herself and the fire, but her precautions were not quite successful.  From that night the child was slightly fatuous, \u2018a half idiot\u2019 (leth \u00f2inseach).  The old woman, it is said, had second sight. \r\n\r\nSee The Gaelic Otherworld, ed.

[this would be in the 1910s -JH].\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic Otherworld, ed Ronald Balack, p452:\r\nNiall M Brownlie informs me that there is in fact a particular Fairy knoll in Tiree called An Cnoc Glas...He says, \"There was a man from Balephuil who, if alone, would not use this right of way under any circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was an old woman in this township who was in the fairy mound. She was a midwife and if there was a baby being born anywhere they would come for her. This night there was a knock on her door and, something that has never been seen around here, there was a coach outside and two white horses. A man asked the midwife if she would attend his wife who was in labour....Away the midwife went. And there is a hillock on the Barrapol machair they call An Cnoc Glas. The coach and horses went right into the hillock and the ground closed behind it, leaving no mark. She delivered the baby and sorted everything out. But when she was washing the baby, a droplet splashed up into her eye and she suddenly was able to see everything inside the hillock for what it was....An old man came over and took hold of the baby and threw it in the middle of the fire...Afterwards the coach took the midwife home, but some time later she was out for a walk when she saw this couple coming along the road. She recognised them as coming from An Cnoc Glas and she stopped to talk to them. One of the women said, 'A drop of water must have gone in your eye.' 'Yes,' said the midwife, and at that the woman spat into her eye...An old man from Balephuil had a relation in Sandaig. When he was coming home, he saw the hillock open once.\" Donald Sinclair, SA1968.021",

It waqs brought by some persons in Scarinish (in the east end of the island) who professed not to believe in taibhsearachd, or second sight.  They gave the loan of it to people in Vaul, on the north side of the island.  Here sights began again to be seen about it, and it was even said that at a time when it was hauled up on dry land, six men were seen rowing in it and one steering.\r\n\tAt last no one at all would venture to sea in the boat, and it was sent back to Scarinish.  So strong was the feeling that the Vaul men would not venture with it through the Black Water (am Bun Dubh), as the sound between Coll and Tiree is called, but drew it across the land to Gott Loch, whence the Scarinish people took it home.  After this its odour in the east end of Tiree became so bad that it was sold again to villagers in the west end, at some distance from the place it originally came from.  Here it terminated its career in Tiree by drowning six men. (Footnote 873)\r\nFootnote 873: Gortendonald, Goirtean D\u00f2mhnaill (\u2018Donald\u2019s Field\u2019) is the Gaelic name for Barrapol (Norse bara \u2018burial-ground\u2019, bol \u2018town\u2019) in the south-western part of Tiree.  Vaul is in Gaelic Bhalla, from Norse fiall \u2018hill\u2019.  \u2018Gott Loch\u2019, Loch Ghot, is Gott Bay.  See p. 262.",

But not only did he obtain the whisky, he also had a generous sampling of hospitality while there. On his way back the dusk of the evening was falling as he passed Heanish, and before he got to Gott in was pitch black.\r\nAs he was passing  Cnoc an t-S\u00ecdhein, he heard the most beautiful music coming from its direction, and in spite of himself he was drawn to it. When he arrived at the knoll the door was open and, in his happy state of mind, he entered without hesitation. Inside was a large number of fairies singing and dancing.\r\nWith the pitcher still on his back, he joined in the merriment until it was nearly dawn. Suddenly realising where he was, he made for the exit, just managing to escape as the door was closing. But on arriving home he discovered it was not one night that he had spent in the fairy knoll but a whole long year.

He was ploughing between the house and the steadings when he found a rock and tried to dig it out. He opened up a souterrain. See the photo in An Iodhlann. John later emigrated to Australia and worked taking resin out of pine trees in Victoria - CMcK.\r\n\r\nAbout eighty years ago John MacIntyre, a crofter in Kilkenneth, discovered an underground dwelling on his holding when he was out ploughing. When the sock of the plough hit a large stone or slab, John noticed that it moved on impact.\r\nAfetr retiring for lunch, John returned with a large crowbar and, being a powerfully built man, he did not take long to dislodge the slab. Below was an opening that led to an underground cavern. He descended into it  with a neighbour, and they discovered a walled vault. Some earthenware utensils and other odds and ends were found in it. It is said that this was the hiding place of the first Brown to come to Tiree. Seemingly he was an outlaw from Ireland, having committed some foul deed ther.

Brown as the name of a colour is an English word but not Gaelic, the Gaelic for it being donn, hence as a clan name many affirm that the Brown of the present day is a corruption or modification of Bruthainn certainly the older name, and till very recently, the name given to sept or portion of the Browns.  There are also many who maintain the oldest form of all is Mac \u2013\u2019ill-duinn.\r\n\r\nOther explanations are also put forward in behalf of the origin of the name, but none of them are satisfactorily conclusive.  The following story of how the Browns came first to Tiree is a tradition as like to be true as any other.  It was heard from a native of the island, well acquainted with the traditions of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe wife of MacLean of Dowart was a daughter of the Lord of the Isles Her father on visiting her at Aros has found her destitute of table-linen, and on her being spoken to on the subject, she said that there was no place on the estate where lint could be grown.  Her father then gave her the island of Tiree as a good flax-growing country, then she might not be open to that reproach any longer.  In this way the island of Tiree remained in the possession of the Dowart family till the forfeiture of the clan towards the end of the seventeenth century.  The MacLeans seem to have ruled the island with a rod of iron.  There is still shewn the hillock called the Bank of the Gallows (Bac na Croiche), where the man who came in last with his rent at collection time was hanged.  A party of strong men called \u2018MacLean\u2019s attributes\u2019 (buaidheanan Mhic-\u2019illeathain) but more correctly oppressors and bullies, were kept in the island to overawe the people.\r\n\r\nThis wife of Dowart, with her galley and men, was at Croig in Mull, awaiting for a passage across to Tiree.  When teh men were getting the galley in order, a big strong man was observed making his way to the boat, His appearance was that of a beggar, with tattered and patched garments (l\u00f9irichean). He quietly asked to be allowed a passage with them.  The master of the boat gruffly refused, saying, that they would not allow one like him to be in the same boat with their mistress, but the beggar said that his being there would make no difference, and asked the favour of getting a passage from her.  She gave him permission and he seated himself at the end of the boat furthest from her to avoid giving trouble to her.  The day was becoming boisterous; it was not long till the master said that the wind was becoming to high, and the day unlikely.  A heavy sea was shipped wetting the Lady of Dowart, and the beggar said to the master, \u201cCan you do better?\u201d  The beggar replied \u201cIt would not be difficult for me to do better than that at any rate.  Show me the direction where you wish to go,\u201d and on it being shewn to him he added \u201cI think you may go on that you will make land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d the other said, \u201cit is none of your business to speak here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lady then spoke, and said to the beggar, \u201cWill you take the boat there if you get the command of it?\u201d  He said he would, and she gave orders to let him have the command.  He sat at the helm and told them to shorten sail, and make everything taut, and now, the boat did not take in a thimbleful of water.  They made for Tiree, and the place come to was the lower part of Hynish, at the furthest extremity of the island.  The first place of shelter which the beggar saw, he let the boat in there.  The little cove is still known as the Port of the Galley (Port-na-Birlinn) on the south side of Barradhu where the present dwellings belonging to the Skerryvore Lighthouse are.  The company landed safely, and on parting the Lady of Dowart told the beggar man to come to see her at Island House, where the residence of the Dowart family was at that time, and which is still the proprietory residence of the island.  The name Island House is derived from its present site having been formerly surrounded by the water of the fresh water lake near it.  It communicated with the rest of the island by means of a draw-bridge, but there being now no necessity for this safeguard the space between the house and the shore has been filled up, and the moated grange has become like ordinary dwelling houses.  The stranger wandered about for some time, and then went to the Island House and was kindly received.  After a day or two, he thought it would be better to get a house for himself, and the Lady of Dowart said that she would give him any place that he himself would fix upon.  Apparently the island was not much tenanted then, and according to the custom of the time, he got a horse with a pack-saddle on, and on the ridge of the saddle (cairb na srathach), he put the upper and lower stones of a quern (br\u00e0thainn), one on each side of the horse, secured by a straw or sea-bent rope, and wherever the rope broke it was lucky to build the house there.  The beggar-man\u2019s quern fell at Sunny Spot (Grianal), now better known as Greenhill.  He built a bothy there, and a woman came to keep house for him.  By her he had a son, whom he would not acknowledge.  When the child was able to take care of itself she went again to him with it that she might be free.  He still refused to receive the child and told her to avoid him.  She then thought as she had heard from him before where he came from, that she would go with her son to his relatives in Ireland.  When she arrived there the child\u2019s grandfather received her very kindly.  She stayed with him till her son had grown to manhood (gus an robh e \u2019na l\u00e0n duine). As she was about to return the grand-father said to his grandson, \u201cWhich do you now prefer, to follow your mother, or stay with me?\u201d  The lad said he would rather follow his mother, and risk his fortune along with her.  They came back to Tiree again, and the son would give no rest till they went to see his father.  When they reached the bothy the mother said \u201cyou will surely receive your son to-day though you would not acknowledge him before.\u201d  But he would not any more than at first.  His son then took hold of him, and putting his knee on his breast, said, \u201cbefore you rise from there you will own me as your son, and my mother as your married wife.\u201d  He did this and was set free.  They then lived together and built a house, and houses, and increased in stock of cattle.  One wild evening in spring, when they were folding the cattle, they observed a stout looking man of mean appearance coming from Kilkenneth, still a township in that part of the island, and making straight for the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw a bigger man than that beggar,\u201d said the son.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is big,\u201d the father said, \u201cI well know what man it is; he is coming after me, and I will lose my life this night, I killed his brother, but it was not my fault, for if I had not killed him, he would have killed me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will not lose your life to-night yet,\u201d said the son, \u201cbe kind to him, and when he has warmed himself, ask him to go out with us to kill a cow, for the night is cold.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger came in and was made welcome.  The old man then said since there was a stranger, and the night chill, they better take a cow and kill it.  They went out and brought in the cow.  The young-man said to the stranger, \u201cWhich would you rather, take the axe, or hold the cow\u2019s horn.?\u201d (Co dhiu b\u2019 fhearr leis an tuath ne\u2019n adharc). The stranger chose to hold the horn, and blow by which the beast was felled was so sudden and unexpected that the stranger fell with it.  The youth immediately fell upon him and kept him down, saying, \u201cYou will only have what you can do for yourself, till you tell why you came here to-night (Cha bhi agad ach na bheir thu g\u2019a chionns gus an aidich thu \u2019de thug so an nochd thu). He told word for word how he came to avenge his brother\u2019s death. (Dh\u2019 innis e facal air an fhacal mar thainig e thoirt mach \u00e8irig a br\u00e0thair).\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not leave this alive\u201d said the young man, \u201cuntil you promise not to molest my father while you remain in the country.\u201d  The stranger vowed, if released he would not offend anyone.  He was allowed to remain and they passed the night cheerfully and peacefully (gu sona s\u00e0mhach). The stranger returned the way he came.  The father and son then settled together, and are said according to tradition, to have been the first Browns in Tiree.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story is, that the first settler in Greenhill was a Campbell, and that he was the maker of those underground dwellings (tighean falaich) which still exist on that farm; curious habitations, which are unlike any building now in use, and worthy of closer examination by antiquarians.  It is said that there are buildings with similar entrances exposed by sand blowing and covered with a great depth of earth in Tra-vi at the distance of two miles or more further south.\r\n\r\nThere is a precipice on the west side of Kenavara hill called Mac-a-Bhriuthainn\u2019s leap (Leum Mhic-a-bhriuthainn) which one of this sept of Browns is said to have jumped across backwards, and which no one has since jumped either backwards or forwards.  The one who took the jump is said to have been chased by a wild ox, which pushed him over the hill, and if he had not been a man of steady eye and limb, the fall would have ended in sure destruction.  The place where he leapt was a ledge in the face of a precipice where the slightest over-balance or weakness, would have precipitated him several hundred feet into a dangerous and deep sea.  No trained tight-rope dancer ever required more sureness of eye or limb than must have been brought into action in this leap.",

Argyllshire Series\u2019 Collected from Oral Sources by the Late Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, Minister of Tiree, Selected from the Author\u2019s MS. Remains, and Edited by Jessie Wallace and Duncan MacIssac, with Introducation by Alfred Nutt. (London; David Nutt, 1895)\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree\r\n\r\nThe Browns of Tiree at the present day are called Brunaich, sing.  Brunach, evidently a word not of a native origin, and likely and adaption of the English Brown.  Brown as the name of a colour is an English word but not Gaelic, the Gaelic for it being donn, hence as a clan name many affirm that the Brown of the present day is a corruption or modification of Bruthainn certainly the older name, and till very recently, the name given to sept or portion of the Browns.  There are also many who maintain the oldest form of all is Mac \u2013\u2019ill-duinn.\r\n\r\nOther explanations are also put forward in behalf of the origin of the name, but none of them are satisfactorily conclusive.  The following story of how the Browns came first to Tiree is a tradition as like to be true as any other.  It was heard from a native of the island, well acquainted with the traditions of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe wife of MacLean of Dowart was a daughter of the Lord of the Isles Her father on visiting her at Aros has found her destitute of table-linen, and on her being spoken to on the subject, she said that there was no place on the estate where lint could be grown.  Her father then gave her the island of Tiree as a good flax-growing country, then she might not be open to that reproach any longer.  In this way the island of Tiree remained in the possession of the Dowart family till the forfeiture of the clan towards the end of the seventeenth century.  The MacLeans seem to have ruled the island with a rod of iron.  There is still shewn the hillock called the Bank of the Gallows (Bac na Croiche), where the man who came in last with his rent at collection time was hanged.  A party of strong men called \u2018MacLean\u2019s attributes\u2019 (buaidheanan Mhic-\u2019illeathain) but more correctly oppressors and bullies, were kept in the island to overawe the people.\r\n\r\nThis wife of Dowart, with her galley and men, was at Croig in Mull, awaiting for a passage across to Tiree.  When teh men were getting the galley in order, a big strong man was observed making his way to the boat, His appearance was that of a beggar, with tattered and patched garments (l\u00f9irichean). He quietly asked to be allowed a passage with them.  The master of the boat gruffly refused, saying, that they would not allow one like him to be in the same boat with their mistress, but the beggar said that his being there would make no difference, and asked the favour of getting a passage from her.  She gave him permission and he seated himself at the end of the boat furthest from her to avoid giving trouble to her.  The day was becoming boisterous; it was not long till the master said that the wind was becoming to high, and the day unlikely.  A heavy sea was shipped wetting the Lady of Dowart, and the beggar said to the master, \u201cCan you do better?\u201d  The beggar replied \u201cIt would not be difficult for me to do better than that at any rate.  Show me the direction where you wish to go,\u201d and on it being shewn to him he added \u201cI think you may go on that you will make land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d the other said, \u201cit is none of your business to speak here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Lady then spoke, and said to the beggar, \u201cWill you take the boat there if you get the command of it?\u201d  He said he would, and she gave orders to let him have the command.  He sat at the helm and told them to shorten sail, and make everything taut, and now, the boat did not take in a thimbleful of water.  They made for Tiree, and the place come to was the lower part of Hynish, at the furthest extremity of the island.  The first place of shelter which the beggar saw, he let the boat in there.  The little cove is still known as the Port of the Galley (Port-na-Birlinn) on the south side of Barradhu where the present dwellings belonging to the Skerryvore Lighthouse are.  The company landed safely, and on parting the Lady of Dowart told the beggar man to come to see her at Island House, where the residence of the Dowart family was at that time, and which is still the proprietory residence of the island.  The name Island House is derived from its present site having been formerly surrounded by the water of the fresh water lake near it.  It communicated with the rest of the island by means of a draw-bridge, but there being now no necessity for this safeguard the space between the house and the shore has been filled up, and the moated grange has become like ordinary dwelling houses.  The stranger wandered about for some time, and then went to the Island House and was kindly received.  After a day or two, he thought it would be better to get a house for himself, and the Lady of Dowart said that she would give him any place that he himself would fix upon.  Apparently the island was not much tenanted then, and according to the custom of the time, he got a horse with a pack-saddle on, and on the ridge of the saddle (cairb na srathach), he put the upper and lower stones of a quern (br\u00e0thainn), one on each side of the horse, secured by a straw or sea-bent rope, and wherever the rope broke it was lucky to build the house there.  The beggar-man\u2019s quern fell at Sunny Spot (Grianal), now better known as Greenhill.  He built a bothy there, and a woman came to keep house for him.  By her he had a son, whom he would not acknowledge.  When the child was able to take care of itself she went again to him with it that she might be free.  He still refused to receive the child and told her to avoid him.  She then thought as she had heard from him before where he came from, that she would go with her son to his relatives in Ireland.  When she arrived there the child\u2019s grandfather received her very kindly.  She stayed with him till her son had grown to manhood (gus an robh e \u2019na l\u00e0n duine). As she was about to return the grand-father said to his grandson, \u201cWhich do you now prefer, to follow your mother, or stay with me?\u201d  The lad said he would rather follow his mother, and risk his fortune along with her.  They came back to Tiree again, and the son would give no rest till they went to see his father.  When they reached the bothy the mother said \u201cyou will surely receive your son to-day though you would not acknowledge him before.\u201d  But he would not any more than at first.  His son then took hold of him, and putting his knee on his breast, said, \u201cbefore you rise from there you will own me as your son, and my mother as your married wife.\u201d  He did this and was set free.  They then lived together and built a house, and houses, and increased in stock of cattle.  One wild evening in spring, when they were folding the cattle, they observed a stout looking man of mean appearance coming from Kilkenneth, still a township in that part of the island, and making straight for the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw a bigger man than that beggar,\u201d said the son.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is big,\u201d the father said, \u201cI well know what man it is; he is coming after me, and I will lose my life this night, I killed his brother, but it was not my fault, for if I had not killed him, he would have killed me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will not lose your life to-night yet,\u201d said the son, \u201cbe kind to him, and when he has warmed himself, ask him to go out with us to kill a cow, for the night is cold.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger came in and was made welcome.  The old man then said since there was a stranger, and the night chill, they better take a cow and kill it.  They went out and brought in the cow.  The young-man said to the stranger, \u201cWhich would you rather, take the axe, or hold the cow\u2019s horn.?\u201d (Co dhiu b\u2019 fhearr leis an tuath ne\u2019n adharc). The stranger chose to hold the horn, and blow by which the beast was felled was so sudden and unexpected that the stranger fell with it.  The youth immediately fell upon him and kept him down, saying, \u201cYou will only have what you can do for yourself, till you tell why you came here to-night (Cha bhi agad ach na bheir thu g\u2019a chionns gus an aidich thu \u2019de thug so an nochd thu). He told word for word how he came to avenge his brother\u2019s death. (Dh\u2019 innis e facal air an fhacal mar thainig e thoirt mach \u00e8irig a br\u00e0thair).\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not leave this alive\u201d said the young man, \u201cuntil you promise not to molest my father while you remain in the country.\u201d  The stranger vowed, if released he would not offend anyone.  He was allowed to remain and they passed the night cheerfully and peacefully (gu sona s\u00e0mhach). The stranger returned the way he came.  The father and son then settled together, and are said according to tradition, to have been the first Browns in Tiree.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story is, that the first settler in Greenhill was a Campbell, and that he was the maker of those underground dwellings (tighean falaich) which still exist on that farm; curious habitations, which are unlike any building now in use, and worthy of closer examination by antiquarians.  It is said that there are buildings with similar entrances exposed by sand blowing and covered with a great depth of earth in Tra-vi at the distance of two miles or more further south.\r\n\r\nThere is a precipice on the west side of Kenavara hill called Mac-a-Bhriuthainn\u2019s leap (Leum Mhic-a-bhriuthainn) which one of this sept of Browns is said to have jumped across backwards, and which no one has since jumped either backwards or forwards.  The one who took the jump is said to have been chased by a wild ox, which pushed him over the hill, and if he had not been a man of steady eye and limb, the fall would have ended in sure destruction.  The place where he leapt was a ledge in the face of a precipice where the slightest over-balance or weakness, would have precipitated him several hundred feet into a dangerous and deep sea.  No trained tight-rope dancer ever required more sureness of eye or limb than must have been brought into action in this leap.\r\n\r\nIn the top of the same hill (Kenavara) there is a well, Briuthainn\u2019s Well  (Tobar Mhic-a-Bhriuthainn), which is said to have its name from the first who came to the island having, in his wanderings, subsisted on its water and wild water-cress",

Balemeanach (Tiree)\r\nPage 564\r\n\r\nD\u00cc-D\u00d2MHNAICH, SUNDAY (DIES DOMINI)\r\nThe name D\u00f2mhnach for our Lord is not common.  It is evidently derived from the Latin Dominus.  It occurs in the proper name Maol D\u00f2mhnaich (Ludovic), literally \u2018the Bald One (i.e the Shaven Priest) of Our Lord,\u2019 a name still to be found in Skye, and formed like Maol Mhoire, Miles (literally \u2018the Priest of St Mary\u2019), Maol Ciaran, Maol Ruainidh, etc.  There is a streamlet near Strowan in Blair Athole called Allt D\u00f2mhnach, the Streamlet of our Lord, and a Tobar an D\u00f2mhnach, the Well of Our Lord, in Balmeanach in the west of Tiree.  In a charm for fulling cloth the expression occurs: \u201cIf he (the wearer of the cloth) enter field of fight, the full succour of our Lord be his\u201d (sl\u00e0n chomraich an D\u00f2mhnach da).\r\nThe day is also known as an D\u00f2mhnach without the prefix of di.  Other names are those occurring in Scripture \u2013 Sabbath, etc.\r\nThe plant pulled on Sunday is, according to a proverbial expression, without good or harm (luibh an D\u00f2mhnach gun mhath gun chron)\r\n\r\nThe water from this well had healing properties.

This is the case at every death of one of the sept but only those who have the second sight can see the shades.  A man married to one of the MacCannels whose father had been long dead enraged her beyond measure, on the occasion of the sept, by asking her why she had not gone to Balevullin (where the death had occurred) last night to see her father. (Footnote 890) \r\n\r\np 510:\r\nFootnote 890: There were MacCannels in Tiree \u2013 at Caolas and Breachachadh \u2013 in 1716 (Maclean-Bristol 1998, pp. 113, 164).  A tailor called Archibald McDonald is listed in a Tiree census of 1776; he his given again amongst the cottars of Kilkennethmore as \u2018Archibald McCannol taylor\u2019 in 1779 (Cregeen 1936, pp. 30, 131).  There were many McConnels among the tenants of Caolas today, having presumably given way to MacDonald.  Not all Tiree MacDonalds will be MacCannels, however.  I do not know whether it is the name behind Eilean Mhic Conaill, a fortified crannog referred to by MacDougall and Cameron (n\/d., p. 80) as \u2018the island of MacConall on Loch Bhasapol.\u2019",

He was a very strong man, and in his brutal violence produced the death of several people.  Tradition also says of him that he killed a water-horse and fought a banshi with a horse-rib at the long hollow, covered in winter with water, called the L\u00e8ig. In this encounter his own little finger was broken.  When sharpening the knives old women in Tiree said, Di-Haoine am baile Mhic a\u2019 Chl\u00e8irich (\u201cFriday in Clark\u2019s town\u2019), with the object of making him and his the objects of Fairy wrath.\r\n\r\nExtracts from 'The Gaelic Otherworld' by John Gregorson Campbell, Edited with commentary by Ronald Black, (Edinburgh; Birlinn, 2005) p58:\r\n\r\nTiree Banshi:\r\nAt the time of the American War of Independence, a native of Tiree, similarly afflicted and wishing to escape from his Fairy love, enlisted and was drafted off to the States.  On landing he thanked God he was now where the hag could not reach him.  Soon after, however, she met him. \u201cYou have given thanks,\u201d she said, \u201cfor getting rid of me, but it is easy for me to make my appearance here as in your own country.\u201d\r\n\tShe then told him what fortunes were to befall him, that he would survive the war and return home, and that she would not then trouble him anymore.  \u201cYou will marry there and settle.  You will have two daughters, one of whom will marry and settle in Croy-Gortan, the other will marry and remain in your own house.  The one away will ask to stay with herself, as her sister will not be kind to you.  Your death will occur when you are crossing the L\u00e8ige.\u201d  All this is due course happened. \r\n\r\nFootnote 196:  In a footnote JGC explains Croy-Gorton as Cruaidh \u2013Ghortain \u2018Stone-Field\u2019 and the L\u00e8ig as a \u2018winter stream falling into Loch Vasipol.\u2019  An Cruaidh Ghoirtean, perhaps more literally \u2018the Hard Field\u2019 and pronounced an Cruairtean in the west of Tiree (cf. p. 282), is simply the Gaelic name for the township of Heylipol (which is from the Norse helgi \u2018holy\u2019 and \u2018bol\u2019 \u2018township\u2019).  The L\u00e8ig (\u2018Marsh\u2019) is a large ditch which flows through the middle of the township of Kilmoluaig into the south-western corner of Loch Vasipol (Loch Bhasapol).  JGC\u2019s L\u00e8ige will be the genitive case \u2013 thar na L\u00e8ige \u2018across the L\u00e8ig\u2019. (See note 152) (This footnote is from page 334).",

        "stories":"Extracts from 'The Gaelic Otherworld' by John Gregorson Campbell, Edited with commentary by Ronald Black, (Edinburgh; Birlinn, 2005) p32-3:\r\n\r\nCalum Clark and His Sore Leg\r\n\r\nSome six generations ago there live at Port Vista (Port Bhiosta) in Tiree a dark, fierce man known as Calum M\u00f2r Mac a\u2019 Chl\u00e8irich, Big Malcolm Clark.  He was a very strong man, and in his brutal violence produced the death of several people.  Tradition also says of him that he killed a water-horse and fought a banshi with a horse-rib at the long hollow, covered in winter with water, called the L\u00e8ig. In this encounter his own little finger was broken.  When sharpening the knives old women in Tiree said, Di-Haoine am baile Mhic a\u2019 Chl\u00e8irich (\u201cFriday in Clark\u2019s town\u2019), with the object of making him and his the objects of Fairy wrath.\r\n\r\nOne evening as he was driving a tether-pin into a hillock, a head was popped up out of the ground and told him to take some other place for securing his beast, as he was letting the rain into \u2018their\u2019 dwelling.   Some time after this he had a painfully sore leg \u2013 bha i gu d\u00f2irainneach doirbh. He went to teh shi-en where the head had appeared, and finding it open, entered in search of a cure for his leg.  The Fairies told him to \u2018put earth on the earth\u2019 \u2018: Cuir an talamh air an talamh. He applied every kind of earth he could think of to the leg, but without effect.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three months he went again to the hillock, and when entering put steel (cruaidh) in the door.  He was told to go out, but he would not, nor would he withdraw the steel till told the proper remedy.   At last he was told to apply criadh ruadh Lochan Ni\u2019 n Shomhairle, the red clay of a small loch in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nHe did so, and the leg as cured.\r\n\r\np319:\r\nSee p. 10. Port Vista (from Norse vist \u2018west\u2019) is in Kilmoluaig, north-west of Loch Bhasapol.  The L\u00e8ig drains through Kilmoluaig into Loch Bhasapol from the south-west (see note 196).  When east coast fishermen came to Port Vista (see Boat Language\u2019, p. 131, and Maclean 1845, p. 215) they called it \u2018The Green\u2019.  At p. 114 Calum M\u00f2r is described as living in Baile nan Cr\u00e0ganach; this will be Baile Nan Cr\u00f2gan in Cornaigmore.  The house must have been somewhere between the two places, where there is only blown sand today.  JGC\u2019s \u2018six generations ago\u2019 suggests that Calum M\u00f2r lived in the period c. 1700, and this is precisely confirmed by the account of a surrender of weapons at Scarinish on 24 April 1716.  Under the heading \u2018Beist\u2019 (Bhiosta) we find that he had taken part with the MacLeans in the rising of 1715 (Maclean-Bristol 1998, p.150): \u201cMalcolm Clerk \/ gave in two guns & a pistol \/ he is to give in a gun which he did thereafter.\u201d\r\n\tNiall M. Brownlie tells me that the only Clarks in Tiree in more recent times were in Ruaig, six miles away in the east of the island.  For full discussion of the name Port Bhiosta(dh) see MacDougall and Cameron n.d., pp. 93-94.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124: \u201cIt was painfully sore.\u201d\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:  Lochan Nighean Shomhairle is \u2018the Lochan of Sorley\u2019s Daughter.\u2019  No doubt the name commemorates a drowning.  The loch is not known to Niall M. Brownlie, and is not marked on the six-inch Ordnance Survey map of Tiree (1883).  Probably, like Clark\u2019s own farm (see p. 114), it had disappeared by then under the \u2018Blown Sand & Bent\u2019 \u2013 JCg\u2019s \u2018blowing sandbanks\u2019 \u2013 marked as lying between Loch Bhasapol and the sea.  Though unknown  nowadays in Tiree, the name Somhairle (\u2018Sorle\u2019) was widespread there in 1716, see Maclean-Bristol  1998, pp. 123, 127, 128, 145.  At the south end of Tr\u00e0igh nan Gillean on the western shore of Tiree there is a rock on the low tide line called Eilean t-Somhairle; 100 yards further out is a reef called Bogha Eilean t-Somhairle.\r\n\r\nThere was a man called Clarke who was farming in Biostadh where the Green is today in the 15th century. He had the best kept farm on the island. He had two sons who were 13 and 15. He went out to work every morning and every dinner time his wife would bring the men a basket of food. One day she couldn\u2019t go and she asked the youngest boy to take the food down instead. On the way to the fields he lifted the cloth and the food tasted so good he tried one scone.  That was so delicious he ended up eating the whole basketful. That night the farmer said to his wife, \u201cHow did you forget us at dinner time?\u201d She replied \u201cI sent down the basket with the youngest boy.\u201d \u201cCome here\u201d said his father. On being questioned he admitted eating the whole basket of food. \u201cSeeing you have eaten the food of seven men, perhaps I will have work for you one day,\u201d said his father.\r\nEvery year at that time it was the custom for a Viking to come to Scarinish harbour in his longship and demand rent from the island. A large fire was lit where the lighthouse is today and the last man to pay his rent was thrown into the fire.\r\nA couple of years later Clark and his younger son set off to pay their rent. At Loch Bhasapol they had to jump over a wide ditch. The father said to his son, \u201cYou didn\u2019t jump that badly. Now we are going to fight and if I win I am going to kill you!\u201d They fought and the old man just came out on top, pinning the young man to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re ready now for the work I had in mind for you.\u201d Was all he said as he let the boy go.\r\nWhen they came to Scarinish, the Viking said to the old farmer, \u201cWhy are you so late with your rent?\u201d Clark replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to fight with me. Fight my son.\u201d \u201cHim,\u201d snorted the Viking. \u201cHe\u2019s only a boy.\u201d But they fought and the boy lifted up the Viking and threw him into the hottest part of the fire. And that was the end of the Vikings coming to Tiree. Angus MacLean, Scarinish, 2\/1996.",

At the height of the fishing boom in the nineteenth century there were many east coast fishermen living at The Green in the summer. One in particular, An Iasgair M\u00f2r [the Big Fisherman], was fighting all comers. The local people determined to sort him out and they sent a man on horseback to Ruaig to fetch the best Tiree fighter, a Lamont nicknamed 'The Currier.' At first Lamont was reluctant to go but his mother persaded him. He set off on the horse and reached The Green. He calmly walked into the taigh-seinnse and went over to the fire and put the tongs in. When they were red-hot he went over to An Iasgair M\u00f2r and grabbed him by the nose with the tongs.

One day when the factor was fault-finding concerning the managemant of his favourite farm, MacLean said to him, \"Come with me and I will show you where the croft boundaries will be.\" Bailtean is Ath-Ghairmean, Townships and Echoes by Niall M Brownlie, Argyll Publishing, 1995, p50-52.\r\n\r\n1.

Iain mac Eachainn Bh\u00e0in told her father that there would be blood in the skies in the young man's time. He fortold to the factor that Heylipol and Hough farms would be broken up. He prophesied that he wouldn't die in bed but \"in the wilderness.\" At the end of his life his son was sleeping with him but the old man got up and went outside and died. There are two prophesies that have not come true yet - there will be sheep grazing on the back of Ben Hough with noone to look after them, and a liner will sink off Tiree and passengers will come ashore in their dinner jackets.

She also lost her rudder and was washed up on the shores of Hough. Nine sailors made it to shore alive and the first water they tasted was water from this well. John Fletcher, Balemartine, 8\/2009.\r\n\r\nExtracts from 'The Gaelic Otherworld' by John Gregorson Campbell, Edited with commentary by Ronald Black, (Edinburgh; Birlinn, 2005), page 229:\r\n\"At the back of Hough Hill in Tiree there is a well called Tobar nan Naoi Be\u00f2 (\u2018the Well of the Nine Living\u2019) which in a season of great scarcity supported a widow and her eight children without any nourishment but itself and shellfish.  Hence its name.\"\r\n \r\nFootnote 803: Cf. CG2, p. 286:  Niall M. Brownlie, who has not seen the well but gives the same tradition (1995, p. 52), has confirmed the name personally to me; thus also MacDougall and Cameron n.d, p. 96 -  The well enjoys, or enjoyed, a spectacular location at the north-western extremity not only of Tiree, but of Argyll as a whole, looking out over Hough Bay to the open Atlantic.  It is not clear to me whether it is to be identified as the well of the old township on the west side of Beinn Hough, which was choked following a sandstorm in the spring of the year of Waterloo, resulting in the removal of people to Kilmoluag (Cregeen 1998, p. 20).\r\n\tIts name deserves to be considered in the contents of the sanctity in which the number nine was allegedy held in Tiree (see pp. lxxxvi, 207 and 655) and of novenary dedications elsewhere.  The latter have been exlplored by Mackinlay (1905-06) and myself (Macilledhuibh 27.7.90), and in much greater detail by Stuart McHardy (2003); for the significance of the number nine in Gaelic tradition generally see CG2, pp. 332-34.  I found a series of wells, altars chapels and fairs in Angus, east Perthshire and Aberdeenshire bearing names like the Nine Maidean Well, the Chapel of the Seven Maidens, Ninemadinchapell and the Nine Virgins Day, along with a story representing these women as daughters of a seventh \u2013 or eighth-century saint called Donald.  Feeling that their cult smacked of river-worship, I concluded that it had become localised at the main junctions of the Tay.\r\n\tMcHardy throws his net much wider, pointing to various locations called Ninewells and claiming for the cult a deciation to St Fyndoca at Innishail in Loch Awe; he discusses islands of women, the magic use of nine (such as at the ninth wave), and stories about nine drawing attention to major figures like Apollo, Arthur, Brigid and Odin who dominate or oversee such groups.  He does not mention Tobar nan Naoi Be\u00f2 (or Tiree), but it fits his model of novenary sites on mountain-tops and islands, associated with Arthur, Brigid, and oak-tress \u2013 MacArthurs are prominent in Tiree, there was a Kilbride at Lag nan Cruachan in Cornaigmore just two miles east, and only the oak-tree is lacking (though tghe presence of peat in Tiree until the nineteenth century shows that this may not always have been the case).\r\n\tI know of no other novenary dedications in Gaelic.  The island and fair of the Nine Virgins at Kenmore were simply Eilean nam Bannoamh (now Prory Island) and F\u00e8ill nam Bannaomh, \u2018the Isle\/Fair of the Female Saints.\u2019  We may therefore ask why Tobar nam Naoi Be\u00f2 is called.  Is it because of the widow and her eight children remained alive when most of the island\u2019s population had died?  Is it because they were survivors of a shipwreck?  Or is it because they live forever as saints in heaven?",

Everywhere it wa deemed unlucky among seafaring men to whistle in case a storm should arise.

When a new school was built following the Education Act (Scotland) Act of 1872 the old one was purchased by Kenneth William MacKenzie as a holiday home. He installed Margaret [the sister of the Rev John Gregorson Campbell] as housekeeper and they fell in love.\"\r\nKenneth William MacKenzie was described on his marriage certificate as Merchant (retired). He was 29 when he married in 1875. Their eldest son was Kenneth MacKenzie - see Bank House, Scarinish.\r\n\r\nAlf Bruton was originally from Oxford. He had come to Tiree in the RAF and had been a sergeant cook on the camp. He met his wife who came from Ruaig, cooking in the same kitchen. He went back to Oxford and worked as a chef in Brasenose College and then in the Oxford Union, where Les was in charge. Alf\u2019s hobby was growing plants and cacti and his kitchen was full of them. He bought the Lodge around 1957. He opened the Lodge Hotel around 1960.

They stayed at first in the manse at Baugh but then moved the Lodge. During WW2 the Lodge was used as a billet for officers. After the war it was empty for a few years before Alf Bruton took it over as a hotel, followed by Charlie Dobson and then the Hutchinsons. Rosie MacIntyre, Gott, 12\/1995.\r\n\r\nAlf Bruton had been a chef for the RAF officers in the war in the Lodge and stayed all war (\u201cthe officers would keep a good chef if they found one\u201d). After the war he became the Oxford Union chef and met Les there. \u201cHis hobbies became his passions,\u201d and had plants growing in the kitchen where the saucepans should have been. He bought the Lodge, which was in a poor state of repair, around 1950. He stocked trout in a loch but they did not thrive because of the gravelly bottom \u2013 Les Crawte, Milton, 9\/1998.\r\n\r\nLady Peggy Hoare from Gloucester rented the Lodge for shooting for 6-8 years after the war.
