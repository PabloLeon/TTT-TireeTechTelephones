Similar agitations were occurring in the Highlands at that time and their efforts were rewarded with an Act of Parliament - the Crofters Act 1886 - which gave tenant crofters legal rights to fair rents and security of tenure for them and their descendents."

	"description": "We are not sure of this rather grand-looking lady's full name, but understand that she was known as Mrs MacLean and that her father may have been a tacksman on Tiree. Tacksmen occupied a sort of 'middle tier' in landownership between the Duke of Argyll and the crofters. Mrs MacLean's father may have been distantly related to the Duke and probably held enough land that he was able to sublet to crofters, whilst retaining his right to the land for generations."

The one pictured here would have originally been thatched, but by the time of the photo had been converted to black felt, and is also partially painted, or 'spotty', as they are known. There are no longer any spotty one-storey cottages such as this one on the island. The spotty appearance was simply to save money on paint, as only the mortar between the stones needs to be painted."
